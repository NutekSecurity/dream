Here are the possible translations of "zafiksowanie sesji" (depending on the context):

1. **Session Fixation:** This is the most likely translation in the context of web security. Session fixation refers to a web security attack where an attacker steals a legitimate user's session ID and keeps it fixed. This allows the attacker to impersonate the user for the duration of the session, potentially gaining unauthorized access to their account and data.

2. **Session Capture:** This is another possible translation, although slightly less common. It generally refers to the act of capturing a user's session ID or other session data, without necessarily implying malicious intent.

3. **Session Recording:** This translation applies if the context refers to recording user activity during a session for analytical or troubleshooting purposes. This is typically done with the user's knowledge and consent.

**Additional Notes:**

* In general, "zafiksowanie" translates to "fixing" or "fixing something in place." 
* When referring to web security, "sesja" translates to "session."

I hope this clarifies the translation based on the context of web security.
