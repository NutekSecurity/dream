Sure, here are the possible translations of "przechwytywanie sesji" (depending on the context):

**1. Session Hijacking:** This is the most common translation in the context of web security. Session hijacking refers to the unauthorized taking over of a user's active session on a website or application. This can be done through various means, such as:

* **Exploiting vulnerabilities in network protocols or websites**
* **Intercepting and modifying network traffic using a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack**
* **Stealing session IDs or cookies through phishing attacks or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks**

Once an attacker hijacks a session, they can impersonate the legitimate user and gain unauthorized access to their account, data, and resources.

**2. Session Capturing:** This translation is less common but may be used in certain contexts. Session capturing generally refers to the act of passively monitoring or recording a user's session activity, typically for analytical or troubleshooting purposes. This may involve capturing session data such as user input, page views, and network traffic.

**3. Session Recording:** This translation is specifically used when referring to the recording of user activity during a session for playback or analysis. This is typically done with the user's knowledge and consent, often for training, user experience research, or troubleshooting purposes.

**Additional Notes:**

* In general, "przechwytywanie" translates to "intercepting" or "capturing."
* When referring to web security, "sesja" translates to "session."

I hope this clarifies the translation based on the context of web security.
