Sure, here is a translation of "ataki związane z ładowaniem plików" (file upload attacks) into English:

**File Upload Attacks**

File upload attacks are a type of cyberattack that exploits vulnerabilities in web applications that allow users to upload files. These attacks can be used to gain unauthorized access to a system, steal sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt operations.

**Common Techniques:**

1. **Malicious File Uploads:** Attackers upload files containing malicious code, such as malware or scripts, that can be executed on the server or client machines.

2. **Unrestricted File Types:** Websites that allow uploading of any file type are more susceptible to attacks, as attackers can upload files that are not typically allowed, such as executable files or scripts.

3. **File Name Spoofing:** Attackers may disguise malicious files with legitimate-looking file extensions, such as ".pdf.exe" or ".doc.macro," to trick users into downloading and executing them.

4. **Exploiting File Processing Vulnerabilities:** Attacks may target specific vulnerabilities in the way the web application processes uploaded files, such as parsing errors or insecure file storage.

**Consequences:**

- **Compromised Systems:** Malicious files can take control of the server or client machines, allowing attackers to steal data, install backdoors, or launch further attacks.

- **Data Breaches:** Sensitive information, such as customer data or financial records, may be stolen or exposed if attackers gain access to file storage systems.

- **Service Disruptions:** Malicious files can disrupt or disable critical services, causing downtime and financial losses.

**Prevention:**

1. **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation to restrict the types of files that can be uploaded and check for common malicious file extensions.

2. **File Sanitization:** Sanitize uploaded files to remove potentially harmful code or scripts before processing or storing them.

3. **Secure File Storage:** Store uploaded files securely in a separate location with appropriate access controls.

4. **Regular Updates:** Keep web applications and server software up-to-date with security patches to address vulnerabilities.

5. **User Education:** Train users to be cautious about opening or executing files from unknown sources and to report suspicious emails or attachments.

By implementing these preventive measures, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to file upload attacks and protect their systems, data, and users.
