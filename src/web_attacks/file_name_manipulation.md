File name manipulation refers to the act of modifying or altering the name of a file to achieve a specific purpose. This can be done for various reasons, both legitimate and malicious.

**Legitimate File Name Manipulation:**

* **File Organization:** File names can be manipulated to organize files in a logical and structured manner, making them easier to find and manage. This can involve using consistent naming conventions, adding descriptive keywords, or incorporating timestamps.
* **File Renaming:** File names can be changed to reflect changes in the file's content, purpose, or ownership. For instance, a document may be renamed after being updated or a file may be renamed to a more accurate or descriptive name.
* **File Compatibility:** File names may be modified to ensure compatibility with different operating systems or applications. This may involve changing file extensions or using specific naming conventions required by certain software.

**Malicious File Name Manipulation:**

* **Hiding Malicious Files:** Attackers may manipulate file names to hide malicious files from antivirus or security software. This can involve using common file extensions associated with harmless file types or disguising malware as legitimate files.
* **Tricking Users:** Attackers may manipulate file names to trick users into opening malicious files. This can involve using names that appear familiar, important, or urgent, enticing users to click on them without hesitation.
* **Bypassing Security Filters:** Attackers may manipulate file names to bypass security filters or firewalls. This can involve using characters or symbols that are not typically used in file names or encoding file names in a way that evades detection.

**Preventing Malicious File Name Manipulation:**

* **File Extension Awareness:** Be cautious of files with unusual or unexpected file extensions. Research the file extension before opening it to ensure it's associated with a trusted application.
* **File Name Inspection:** Carefully examine file names before opening them. Look for suspicious characters, symbols, or unusual naming conventions that could indicate a malicious file.
* **Security Software Updates:** Keep your antivirus and security software up to date to ensure they have the latest definitions and detection capabilities for known malware techniques.
* **Safe Download Practices:** Only download files from trusted sources and scan them for malware before opening them.
* **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of file name manipulation and how to identify and avoid suspicious files.

By following these practices, users can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to malicious file name manipulation and protect their devices from malware infections and unauthorized access.
