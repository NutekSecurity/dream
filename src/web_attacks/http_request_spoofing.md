Here's the translation of "sfałszowanie żądania HTTP" (falsified HTTP request) into English:

**HTTP Request Spoofing**

HTTP request spoofing refers to a cyberattack technique where attackers forge or manipulate HTTP requests to trick a server into believing they originate from a trusted source. These forged requests can be used for various malicious purposes, depending on the attacker's intent.

**How HTTP Request Spoofing Works:**

1. **Spoofed Source:** Attackers modify the source IP address or other identifying information in an HTTP request to make it appear as if it's coming from a legitimate user or device.
2. **Targeted Server:** The attacker sends the spoofed request to a specific server, aiming to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or disrupt operations.
3. **Deception:** Since the server may not be able to distinguish the spoofed request from a genuine one, it may process the request and potentially grant access or perform actions based on the attacker's intent.

**Common HTTP Request Spoofing Attacks:**

* **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** Attackers can spoof a large number of HTTP requests from different sources, overwhelming the target server and causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users.
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Attackers can position themselves between the victim and the server, intercepting and modifying HTTP requests to steal data or redirect traffic.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms to spoof requests with higher privileges than they actually possess.
* **Website Defacement:** Spoofed requests can be used to modify the content of a website, displaying attacker-controlled messages or propaganda.

**Prevention of HTTP Request Spoofing:**

* **IP Address Validation:** Implement stricter IP address validation to identify and potentially block requests originating from suspicious or unexpected sources.
* **Source Port Verification:** Analyze the source port number of incoming requests, as attackers might struggle to spoof both IP address and port simultaneously.
* **Strict Access Control:** Implement robust access control mechanisms to limit access to sensitive resources and functionalities based on user roles and permissions.
* **Traffic Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic for anomalies and suspicious patterns that might indicate spoofed requests.
* **Use of Security Protocols:** Utilize secure protocols like HTTPS that encrypt communication and make it more difficult to manipulate requests in transit.

By implementing these security measures, system administrators can enhance their defenses against HTTP request spoofing attacks and protect servers from unauthorized access and malicious activities.
