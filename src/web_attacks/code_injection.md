The translation of "wstrzykiwanie kodu" (wstrzykiwanie meaning "injection") into English is **code injection**.

Code injection is a type of cyberattack that exploits vulnerabilities in software to inject malicious code into a trusted system. This injected code can then be executed by the system, allowing attackers to perform various actions depending on their intent. Here are some common types of code injection attacks:

* **SQL Injection:** Injects malicious SQL code into database queries to steal sensitive data, modify data, or disrupt database operations.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injects malicious JavaScript code into websites to steal user cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the website.
* **Command Injection:** Injects malicious operating system commands into applications to gain unauthorized access to a system or execute commands on the server.
* **LDAP Injection:** Injects malicious code into Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) queries to manipulate user data or gain unauthorized access to directory services.

**Consequences of Code Injection:**

* **Data Breaches:** Attackers can steal sensitive data, such as personal information, financial records, or intellectual property.
* **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts or systems.
* **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** Attackers can disrupt operations by overloading systems with malicious code.
* **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify the content of a website, displaying messages or propaganda.

**Preventing Code Injection:**

* **Input Validation:** Sanitize all user input to remove potentially harmful code before processing it.
* **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries to separate data from code, preventing user input from being interpreted as SQL statements.
* **Output Encoding:** Encode special characters in user input to prevent browsers from interpreting them as part of the script.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in software.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Developers should follow secure coding practices to avoid introducing vulnerabilities that could be exploited for code injection attacks.

By implementing these security measures, developers and organizations can significantly reduce the risk of code injection attacks and protect their systems and data from unauthorized access and malicious activities.
