The direct translation of "wstrzykiwanie sesji" (wstrzykiwanie meaning "injection") is **session injection**. However, this term isn't commonly used in the context of web security.

Here are two possible interpretations and their corresponding translations that are more relevant to web security:

1. **Session Hijacking:** This is the more likely interpretation. Session hijacking refers to the unauthorized takeover of a user's existing session on a website or application. Attackers can achieve this through various techniques, such as:

* Stealing session cookies: Attackers can steal session cookies, which are small pieces of data stored on a user's device that identify their logged-in state, and use them to impersonate the legitimate user.
* Exploiting session vulnerabilities: Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in web applications or protocols to manipulate session data and gain unauthorized access.

2. **Session Fixation:** This is a less common interpretation but can also be relevant. Session fixation refers to the act of an attacker stealing a legitimate user's session ID and keeping it fixed. This allows the attacker to impersonate the user for the duration of the session, potentially gaining unauthorized access to their account and data.

**In conclusion:**

* Depending on the context, "wstrzykiwanie sesji" could translate to **session hijacking** or **session fixation**.
* Session hijacking is the more common term used in web security to describe unauthorized session takeover.
