The translation of "podsłuchiwanie haseł" (podслушивание паролей) is **password sniffing**.

Password sniffing refers to the act of capturing passwords transmitted over a network in an unencrypted format. This can be done through various techniques, such as:

* **Packet Sniffing:** Attackers use network sniffers to capture all network traffic on a specific network segment, potentially capturing unencrypted passwords transmitted between devices.
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Attackers position themselves between a user and the server they are communicating with, intercepting and potentially modifying network traffic, including passwords.
* **Unsecured Wi-Fi Networks:** Attackers can exploit unencrypted Wi-Fi networks to capture network traffic, including passwords transmitted between devices connected to the same network.

**Consequences of Password Sniffing:**

* **Account Takeover:** Attackers who capture a user's password can use it to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to their accounts.
* **Data Theft:** Attackers can use stolen passwords to access sensitive data stored within compromised accounts.
* **Financial Loss:** Attackers may use stolen passwords to commit financial fraud or purchase goods and services using the victim's accounts.

**Preventing Password Sniffing:**

To prevent password sniffing, users and organizations should follow these security practices:

* **Use Strong Passwords:** Choose strong and unique passwords for all online accounts.
* **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Whenever possible, activate 2FA to add an extra layer of security beyond just a password.
* **Avoid Unsecured Wi-Fi Networks:** Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for accessing sensitive information or logging into accounts. If using public Wi-Fi, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your network traffic.
* **Use HTTPS Everywhere:** Ensure websites you visit use HTTPS encryption to encrypt communication between your browser and the server, protecting passwords from being captured during transmission.
* **Keep Software Updated:** Keep your operating system, web browser, and other software updated with the latest security patches to address vulnerabilities that could be exploited for password sniffing attacks.

By following these practices, individuals and organizations can significantly reduce the risk of password sniffing and protect their passwords and sensitive information from unauthorized interception and malicious use.
