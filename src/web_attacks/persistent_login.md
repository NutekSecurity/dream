"Trwa≈Çy login" can have two possible translations in the context of web security, depending on the specific meaning:

1. **Persistent Login:** This is the most likely translation. A persistent login, also known as "stay signed in" or "remember me" functionality, is a feature on websites or applications that allows users to remain logged in for a specific period after closing their browser or application. This eliminates the need to re-enter their credentials every time they want to access the service.

2. **Permanent Login:** This translation is less common but could be used in specific contexts. A permanent login would imply a login that never expires and the user remains logged in indefinitely. This is generally not a secure practice and is rarely used on modern websites due to the security risks associated with it.

Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons of persistent logins:

**Pros:**

* **Convenience:** Users don't need to re-enter their credentials every time they want to access the service.
* **Improved User Experience:** Makes using the website or application faster and more convenient.

**Cons:**

* **Security Risks:** If a device is lost or stolen, an attacker could gain access to the user's account if a persistent login is enabled.
* **Increased Risk of Phishing Attacks:** Persistent logins can be a target for phishing attacks, where attackers trick users into logging in to a fake website that steals their credentials.

**Recommendations:**

* **Use persistent logins with caution:** Only enable persistent logins on trusted devices.
* **Set short expiration times:** Consider using shorter expiration times for persistent logins to minimize the risk if a device is compromised.
* **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):**  2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification factor, such as a code from a mobile device, in addition to a password. This helps protect accounts even if an attacker steals the user's password.
