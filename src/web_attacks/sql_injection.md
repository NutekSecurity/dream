Here's the translation of "wstrzykiwanie kodu SQL" (SQL injection) into English:

**SQL Injection**

SQL injection is a type of cyberattack that exploits vulnerabilities in web applications to inject malicious SQL code into database queries. This injected code can then be executed by the database server, potentially allowing attackers to:

* **Steal sensitive data:** Attackers can use SQL injection to manipulate database queries and retrieve sensitive information like user credentials, financial records, or personal details.
* **Modify data:** Attackers can modify existing data in the database, potentially causing disruption, corruption, or unauthorized changes.
* **Delete data:** Attackers can delete valuable data stored in the database, resulting in data loss and potential business disruptions.
* **Disrupt operations:** Attackers can disrupt database operations by overloading the server with malicious queries, causing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

**How SQL Injection Works:**

1. **Vulnerable Input Field:** Attackers identify an application form or other input field that allows user input to be passed directly into a database query.
2. **Malicious Code Injection:** Attackers craft malicious SQL code and inject it into the user input field. This code can be disguised within seemingly harmless data.
3. **Unaware Execution:** The web application processes the user input, unknowingly passing the injected SQL code to the database server.
4. **Unauthorized Actions:** The database server executes the injected code, potentially granting attackers unauthorized access to data, modifying data, or disrupting operations.

**Preventing SQL Injection:**

* **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to sanitize user input and remove any potentially harmful code before it reaches the database layer.
* **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries that separate code and data, preventing user input from being directly interpreted as SQL statements.
* **Stored Procedures:** Utilize stored procedures pre-defined on the database server, reducing the risk of injecting malicious code through user input.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in web applications that could be exploited for SQL injection attacks.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Developers should follow secure coding practices to avoid introducing vulnerabilities in the way they interact with databases.

By implementing these security measures, web developers can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks and safeguard sensitive data stored in databases.
