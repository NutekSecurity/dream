Sure, here are the translations of "pliki i polecenia trawersowanie katalog√≥w" (files and commands directory traversal) into English:

**Files and Commands Directory Traversal**

Directory traversal, also known as path traversal, is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to access files or execute commands outside of the intended directory structure. This vulnerability arises when applications fail to properly validate user-supplied input, allowing attackers to manipulate paths to reach unauthorized locations.

**Exploiting Directory Traversal:**

Attackers can exploit directory traversal vulnerabilities in various ways, including:

* **Accessing Sensitive Files:** Attackers can access sensitive files, such as configuration files, database files, or source code, that are not intended to be accessible from the web or from specific user accounts.
* **Executing Commands:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server by manipulating paths to reach system utilities or shell scripts. This can lead to system compromise, data theft, or malware execution.
* **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** Attackers can exploit directory traversal to cause DoS attacks by consuming server resources or disrupting system operations.

**Examples of Directory Traversal Attacks:**

* **Up-Directory Traversal:** Attackers can use ".." sequences to traverse up the directory tree, gaining access to files or directories located above the intended application root.
* **Null Byte (0x00) Traversal:** Attackers can use null bytes to terminate path strings prematurely, allowing them to bypass security checks and access unauthorized locations.
* **Alternative Path Characters:** Attackers can use alternative path characters, such as backslash (\) or forward slash (/), to confuse the application's path parsing logic and gain unauthorized access.

**Preventing Directory Traversal Attacks:**

To prevent directory traversal attacks, developers and organizations should implement the following security measures:

* **Input Validation:** Sanitize all user-supplied input, including path names, to remove potentially harmful characters or sequences.
* **Canonicalize Paths:** Canonicalize paths to ensure they represent the intended directory structure and do not contain relative or symbolic links.
* **Restrict File Access:** Restrict file access to only the necessary directories and permissions, preventing unauthorized users from accessing sensitive files.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices to avoid introducing vulnerabilities that could be exploited for directory traversal attacks.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential directory traversal vulnerabilities in software and applications.

By implementing these security measures, developers and organizations can significantly reduce the risk of directory traversal attacks and protect their systems and data from unauthorized access and malicious activities.
