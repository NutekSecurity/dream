The translation of "wstrzykiwanie polece≈Ñ" is **command injection**.

Command injection is a type of cyberattack that exploits vulnerabilities in software to inject malicious commands into a system. These injected commands are then executed by the system with the privileges of the application or user running it, allowing attackers to perform various actions depending on their intent.

Here are some common consequences of command injection attacks:

* **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to a system or user account by exploiting the privileges associated with the application or user.
* **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive data, such as personal information, financial records, or confidential files, by executing commands that access or manipulate data storage systems.
* **System Damage:** Attackers can execute commands that damage the operating system, applications, or data on the system, causing disruptions or data loss.
* **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** Attackers can execute commands that consume system resources or disrupt services, preventing legitimate users from accessing the system.

**Examples of Command Injection Vulnerabilities:**

* **Unvalidated User Input:** Applications that fail to properly validate user input can be exploited by attackers to inject malicious commands through forms, search bars, or other user input fields.
* **Improper Scripting:** Scripts that combine user input with system commands without proper sanitization can be vulnerable to command injection if the user input is not validated.
* **Misconfigured Applications:** Applications that are not properly configured or are running with unnecessary privileges can be more susceptible to command injection attacks.

**Preventing Command Injection:**

To prevent command injection attacks, developers and organizations can implement the following security measures:

* **Input Validation:** Sanitize all user input to remove potentially harmful characters or sequences that could be used for command injection.
* **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries to separate data from commands, preventing user input from being interpreted as part of the system command.
* **Least Privilege:** Implement the principle of least privilege, granting applications or users only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks. This reduces the potential damage caused by a successful command injection attack.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential command injection vulnerabilities in software and applications.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Developers should follow secure coding practices to avoid introducing vulnerabilities that could be exploited for command injection attacks.

By implementing these security measures, developers and organizations can significantly reduce the risk of command injection attacks and protect their systems and data from unauthorized access, data theft, and system damage.
