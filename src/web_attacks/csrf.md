Here's the translation of "ataki typu csrf" into English:

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

Cross-Site Request Forgery, often abbreviated as CSRF, is a type of web security attack that exploits a user's existing, authenticated session on a trusted website to perform unauthorized actions. Attackers trick the victim's browser into sending unwanted requests to the trusted website, often resulting in actions the user didn't intend or authorize.

**How CSRF Attacks Work:**

1. **Target Website:** Attackers target a website where the victim has an active login session with valid cookies or authentication tokens.
2. **Malicious Link or Form:** The attacker creates a malicious link or form embedded in an email, social media post, or website.
3. **Unaware Request:** When the victim clicks the link or submits the form, their browser automatically sends a request to the targeted website along with their valid session cookies or tokens.
4. **Unauthorized Action:** The website processes the request based on the victim's authenticated session, performing the action dictated by the attacker's crafted request.

**Common CSRF Attack Scenarios:**

* **Transferring Funds:** An attacker might create a link that, when clicked by a logged-in user of an online bank, initiates a money transfer to the attacker's account.
* **Changing Account Settings:** An attacker might create a form that, when submitted by a logged-in user of a social media platform, changes their profile information or privacy settings.
* **Posting Comments:** An attacker might embed a form that, when submitted by a logged-in user of a forum, posts a specific message on their behalf.

**CSRF Prevention:**

* **CSRF Tokens:** Websites can generate unique CSRF tokens for each user session and embed them in forms or links. The server verifies the presence and validity of the CSRF token before processing the request.
* **SameSite Cookie Attribute:** Setting the `SameSite` cookie attribute to `Strict` can prevent CSRF attacks that rely on cookies sent across different websites.
* **Double Submit Cookies:** Double submit cookies can be used to confirm user intent for sensitive actions, requiring a separate confirmation step before processing the request.
* **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of clicking on unknown links or forms, especially those received via email or social media.

By implementing these security measures, web developers can significantly reduce the risk of CSRF attacks and protect users' accounts and data from unauthorized actions.
