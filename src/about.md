# About the author

Szymon Bronisław Błaszczyński is a software engineer with a passion for programming and teaching. He has been working in the IT industry for over 10 years. He is a big fan of Python and Django. He is also, a good
joker, because that's not him. His passion is music, he likes to write,
used to write on walls (don't do this!), he does not remember how to use
simple functions, or to properly open a file in any language, so
he use a lot of AI - it is a miracle that he can write this text. He is
a big fan of Rust, but he started with Go, in programming since his 10th,
and when asked what he can program, he says "I can write a program that is
an infinite loop." To earn his associate degree in IT, he had to break into
Windows 7, and he did it. He is a big fan of Linux, but he uses Windows10 -
again, good, joke AI - he hates Linus Torvalds for not admitting he's an
inventor of Git, and that Windows is better than Linux (well, it's not,
but mr. Linus is not the GNU Linux environment, without which, there would
be no need, for a fight if kernel could be written in Rust). I'm still
amazed by blazingly fast macOS, love my iPhone and full of high tones.
