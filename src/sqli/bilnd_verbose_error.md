# Verbose error response

Verbose SQL error messages can sometimes contain sensitive data, such as the database schema, table names, column names, and even data values. This can happen if the application or database server is not properly configured to sanitize error messages.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious input into a web application that is used to interact with a database. The malicious input can be designed to cause the application to generate a verbose error message that contains sensitive data.

For example, the attacker could inject a single quote character into the input field. This would cause the application to generate an error message that contains the full SQL query that was executed. The attacker could then use this information to further exploit the vulnerability.

There are a few things that can be done to prevent this vulnerability:

* The application should be configured to sanitize error messages. This can be done by using a library or framework that provides this functionality.
* The database server should be configured to log errors to a file that is not accessible to the public.
* The application should be tested for SQL injection vulnerabilities. This can be done using a variety of tools and techniques.

If you believe that a web application may be vulnerable to this type of attack, you should report it to the application owner.

Here are some additional tips for preventing verbose SQL error messages from containing sensitive data:

* Use prepared statements instead of dynamic SQL.
* Use bind variables instead of literal values in SQL queries.
* Sanitize all user input before it is used in a SQL query.
* Log errors to a file that is not accessible to the public.

By following these tips, you can help to prevent sensitive data from being exposed in verbose SQL error messages.

Extracting sensitive data via verbose SQL error messages is a technique used in SQL injection attacks where an attacker leverages error messages generated by the database server to gain insights into the structure of the database or extract sensitive information. In this scenario, the attacker injects malicious SQL code into vulnerable application inputs, causing the database server to produce detailed error messages that reveal valuable information about the database.

Here's how attackers can extract sensitive data via verbose SQL error messages:

1. **Identifying Vulnerable Points:** The attacker identifies input fields in the application, such as login forms, search bars, or user registration forms, where user-supplied data is directly inserted into SQL queries without proper validation or sanitization. These points are potential entry points for SQL injection.

2. **Injecting Malicious SQL Code:** The attacker crafts input payloads containing SQL code that causes errors. Common techniques include using single quotes, double quotes, or SQL keywords to manipulate the original query.

3. **Analyzing Error Messages:** When the attacker submits the malicious payload, the database server encounters an error due to the malformed SQL query. In response, the server may generate verbose error messages, which are either displayed directly to the user or logged in application logs. These error messages might include useful information such as:

   - The database type and version.
   - Table names, column names, or database schema information.
   - Partial or complete SQL queries that failed.

4. **Exploiting Information Leakage:** The attacker analyzes the verbose error messages to extract sensitive information. For example, they may deduce the structure of the database, discover the names of tables or columns, or even identify usernames, passwords, or other confidential data.

Example:

Suppose an e-commerce website's search feature is vulnerable to SQL injection. The search functionality executes an SQL query like this:

```sql
SELECT product_name, price FROM products WHERE product_name LIKE '%user_input%';
```

The `user_input` is directly concatenated into the query without proper sanitization. The attacker crafts a malicious input:

```
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users; --
```

The resulting query becomes:

```sql
SELECT product_name, price FROM products WHERE product_name LIKE '%' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users; -- %';
```

If the attacker submits this payload, the database server might generate an error message like:

```
Error: Operand should contain 1 column(s)
```

From the error message, the attacker learns that the `products` and `users` tables are present, and they can now attempt to extract usernames and passwords from the `users` table using further injections.

Preventing Verbose SQL Error Messages:

To prevent verbose SQL error messages from revealing sensitive data, developers should:

1. Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques.
2. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate data from SQL code.
3. Disable detailed error messages for production environments.
4. Regularly update the database management system to address known vulnerabilities.

By adopting these best practices, developers can reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

### Example of verbose error during SQL injection, that let us extract information

Sure. The Visible error-based SQL injection tutorial example in PortSwigger Academy demonstrates how a website can be vulnerable to error-based SQL injection attacks.

In the tutorial, the user is first prompted to enter their username and password. After they have successfully entered their credentials, they are logged in to the website.

The website is vulnerable to error-based SQL injection because it does not properly sanitize user input. This means that an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the website's database.

The attacker can use this vulnerability to extract data from the database by injecting malicious SQL code that will cause an error. When the error occurs, the website will display the error message to the user. This error message can contain sensitive information, such as database usernames and passwords.

To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would first need to identify a database table that they want to extract data from. They can do this by submitting a variety of malicious SQL queries and observing the error messages. Once the attacker has identified a table, they can then use error messages to extract the table contents.

The Visible error-based SQL injection tutorial example is a good demonstration of how a website can be vulnerable to error-based SQL injection attacks. It is important to be aware of these vulnerabilities and to take steps to protect yourself.

Here are some tips for protecting yourself from error-based SQL injection attacks:

* Use a strong username and password for your online accounts.
* Change your passwords regularly.
* Be suspicious of emails or text messages that ask for your personal information.
* Install antivirus software and keep it up to date.
* Be careful about what websites you visit and what links you click on.
* Train yourself and your employees on how to identify and avoid phishing attacks.

By following these tips, you can help to protect yourself from error-based SQL injection attacks and keep your accounts safe.

In addition to the tips above, there are a few things that the website can do to protect itself from error-based SQL injection attacks:

* Use a rate limiting mechanism to prevent users from submitting too many requests in a short period of time.
* Use a honeypot account to lure attackers into entering malicious SQL queries.
* Implement a CAPTCHA challenge to verify that the user is human.
* Use a prepared statement mechanism to prevent attackers from injecting malicious SQL code into the database.

By implementing these measures, the website can help to protect itself from error-based SQL injection attacks.
