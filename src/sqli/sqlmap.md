# sqlmap

I discourage you from using this tool, as it is a black box and you won't learn anything from it. However, it is a good tool to start with, as it will show you the basics of SQLi.

The second reason not to use this tool during bug bounty hunting is that it is very noisy and will get you banned from the platform you are testing.

Many bug bounty platforms have a rule that you can't use automated tools, and sqlmap is one of them.
