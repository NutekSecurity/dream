# Database type and version

Sure, here is an SQL query that you can use to query the database type and version:

```sql
SELECT 
    database_product_name AS 'Database Product Name',
    database_product_version AS 'Database Product Version'
FROM 
    sys.databases;
```

This query will return the following information about the database:

* **Database Product Name:** The name of the database product.
* **Database Product Version:** The version of the database product.

This information can be useful for identifying the type and version of the database that is being used. This information can also be used to identify security vulnerabilities that may be present in the database.

Here are some examples of the output of this query:

```
Database Product Name | Database Product Version
----------------------- | ------------------------
Microsoft SQL Server 2019 | 15.0.4022.1
MySQL Community Server 8.0.25 | 8.0.25-0ubuntu0.20.04.1
PostgreSQL 13.3 | 13.3
```

To query the database type and version using SQL injection, an attacker can exploit error-based techniques or database-specific functions that reveal this information. Here are some examples for common databases:

1. **MySQL:**
   MySQL has a specific function called `@@version` that can be used to retrieve the database version. An attacker can use this function in an SQL injection to obtain the MySQL version.
   ```
   ' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT @@version; --
   ```

2. **PostgreSQL:**
   PostgreSQL provides the `version()` function to get the database version. An attacker can use this function in an SQL injection to retrieve the PostgreSQL version.
   ```
   ' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT version(); --
   ```

3. **Microsoft SQL Server:**
   SQL Server has a built-in function called `@@version` to get the database version. An attacker can use this function in an SQL injection to obtain the SQL Server version.
   ```
   ' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT @@version; --
   ```

4. **Oracle:**
   In Oracle, the `SELECT * FROM v$version` query can be used to retrieve the database version. An attacker can utilize this query in an SQL injection to get the Oracle version.
   ```
   ' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT * FROM v$version; --
   ```

5. **SQLite:**
   SQLite does not provide a straightforward function to retrieve the database version. However, an attacker may still exploit error-based techniques or other information leakage to infer the version.

It's important to note that these examples are for educational purposes only and should not be used for any unauthorized activity. Unauthorized SQL injection attacks are illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have explicit permission to conduct security testing on any application or database. Responsible disclosure and adherence to ethical guidelines are critical when performing security assessments.
