# How many columns

Use following injected staments to know how many columns you can return from UNION attack.

```sql
' ORDER BY 1--
' ORDER BY 2--
' ORDER BY 3--
etc.
```
or

```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--
etc.
```

until you get no error.

The number of columns required in a SQL injection UNION attack depends on the number of columns in the target table. The attacker must inject enough columns to match the number of columns in the target table, or the attack will fail.

For example, let's say the target table has 3 columns: `id`, `name`, and `email`. The attacker would need to inject 3 columns into the UNION statement, or the attack would fail.

The following is an example of a UNION statement that would work against a target table with 3 columns:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email FROM users UNION SELECT 1, 2, 3;
```

This statement would cause the database to return the results of both queries, which would include the first three rows in the `users` table.

If the attacker was only interested in the `id` column, they could use the following statement:

```sql
SELECT id FROM users UNION SELECT 1;
```

This statement would cause the database to return the first row in the `users` table, which would only contain the `id` column.

It is important to note that the attacker must inject the correct number of columns, or the attack will fail. If the attacker injects too many columns, the database will ignore the extra columns. If the attacker injects too few columns, the attack will fail.

Here are some ways to protect against UNION attacks:

* **Use prepared statements:** Prepared statements are a way of preventing SQL injection attacks by binding the input parameters to the query before it is executed.
* **Sanitize user input:** This involves removing any special characters that could be used to inject malicious code.
* **Use a web application firewall (WAF):** A WAF is a software application that can help to protect web applications from a variety of attacks, including SQL injection attacks.

Determining the number of columns required in a SQL injection UNION attack involves a trial-and-error process. The goal is to identify the number of columns needed in the injected query to match the columns selected in the original query. Here's a step-by-step approach to finding the correct number of columns:

1. **Identify a Vulnerable Parameter:** First, you need to find a parameter in the application's URL or form inputs that is vulnerable to SQL injection. This parameter should be directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization.

2. **Inject an Initial Query:** Once you've identified the vulnerable parameter, inject a simple query that returns a known number of columns, such as `SELECT 1`.

3. **Test for Errors:** Submit the injected query and observe the response. If you see an error, it means the query wasn't executed successfully. Try changing the injected query until you get a valid response without errors.

4. **Use UNION SELECT:** Now, modify the injected query to use the `UNION SELECT` statement to combine it with the original query. For example, if the original query is:
   ```sql
   SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM table_name WHERE some_condition;
   ```

   Your injected query should look like:
   ```sql
   injected_parameter' UNION SELECT 1, 2, 3 --
   ```

   The `--` at the end of the injected query is used to comment out any remaining SQL code.

5. **Check the Number of Columns:** After injecting the `UNION SELECT` statement, check the response from the application. If the number of columns in the injected query matches the number of columns in the original query, you will get a valid response. Otherwise, you might get an error or incomplete results.

6. **Increment the Number of Columns:** If the number of columns in the injected query doesn't match the original query, keep incrementing the number of columns in the `UNION SELECT` statement until you get a valid response. For example:
   ```sql
   injected_parameter' UNION SELECT 1, 2, 3, 4 --
   injected_parameter' UNION SELECT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 --
   ```

7. **Fine-tune the Data Types:** Once you find the correct number of columns, you may need to fine-tune the data types and format in the `UNION SELECT` statement to match the data types of the columns in the original query. You can use functions like `CAST` or `CONVERT` to achieve this.

Remember that the number of columns may vary depending on the application and the specific query you are targeting. The trial-and-error process may take some time, but it's crucial for successful SQL injection UNION attacks. Be patient and thorough in your testing.

Sure. The SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query tutorial example in PortSwigger Academy demonstrates how an attacker can use a UNION attack to determine the number of columns returned by a query.

In the tutorial, the user is first prompted to enter their username and password. After they have successfully entered their credentials, they are logged in to the website.

The website is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not properly sanitize user input. This means that an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the website's database.

The attacker can use this vulnerability to determine the number of columns returned by a query by using a UNION attack. A UNION attack is a technique that allows an attacker to combine the results of two or more SQL queries into a single result set.

To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would first need to identify a database table that contains the data they want to retrieve. They can do this by submitting a variety of malicious SQL queries and observing the results. Once the attacker has identified a table, they can then use a UNION attack to determine the number of columns returned by the query.

For example, the attacker could submit the following malicious query:

```sql
SELECT name, 'a' FROM users UNION SELECT email, 'a' FROM users --
```

This query will combine the results of the `SELECT name, 'a' FROM users` query with the results of the `SELECT email, 'a' FROM users` query. The result set will contain all of the names and emails of the users in the database, along with the string "a".

The attacker can then count the number of columns in the result set. This will be the number of columns returned by the original query.

The attacker could then use this information to launch further attacks, such as phishing attacks or password guessing attacks.

The SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query tutorial example is a good demonstration of how an attacker can use a UNION attack to determine the number of columns returned by a query. It is important to be aware of this vulnerability and to take steps to protect yourself.

Here are some tips for protecting yourself from UNION attacks:

* Use a strong username and password for your online accounts.
* Change your passwords regularly.
* Be suspicious of emails or text messages that ask for your personal information.
* Install antivirus software and keep it up to date.
* Be careful about what websites you visit and what links you click on.
* Train yourself and your employees on how to identify and avoid phishing attacks.

By following these tips, you can help to protect yourself from UNION attacks and keep your accounts safe.

In addition to the tips above, there are a few things that the website can do to protect itself from UNION attacks:

* Use a rate limiting mechanism to prevent users from submitting too many requests in a short period of time.
* Use a honeypot account to lure attackers into entering malicious SQL queries.
* Implement a CAPTCHA challenge to verify that the user is human.
* Use a prepared statement mechanism to prevent attackers from injecting malicious SQL code into the database.
* Use a database auditing mechanism to detect and log suspicious SQL queries.

By implementing these measures, the website can help to protect itself from UNION attacks.
