# Gunicorn Web Server
## Running a Gunicorn Web Server

Gunicorn is a popular Python web server gateway interface (WSGI) HTTP server for Unix-like systems. It's known for its performance, efficiency, and ease of use. Here's how to run a Gunicorn web server:

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.6 or later
* Gunicorn installed (`pip install gunicorn`)
* Your WSGI application file (e.g., `app.py`)

**Basic Usage:**

1. **Navigate to your application directory:** Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your WSGI application file.
2. **Run the Gunicorn command:** Use the following command to start the Gunicorn server:

```bash
gunicorn app:app
```

This command tells Gunicorn to:

* Load the WSGI application defined in the `app` variable within the `app.py` file.
* Start a single worker process by default.

**Output:**

You should see output in the terminal similar to this:

```
[2023-11-15 10:00:00 +0000] [9984] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.1.0
[2023-11-15 10:00:00 +0000] [9984] [INFO] Listening at: http://127.0.0.1:8000 (9984)
[2023-11-15 10:00:00 +0000] [9984] [INFO] Using worker: sync
[2023-11-15 10:00:00 +0000] [9990] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 9990
```

This indicates that the Gunicorn server is running and listening for connections on port 8000 by default.

**Access your application:** You can now access your application in a web browser by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (or the appropriate IP address and port if you're running the server on a different machine).

**Additional Options:**

Gunicorn offers various options for customization. Here are some commonly used options:

* `-b \u003caddress\u003e:\u003cport\u003e`: Specify the IP address and port to bind the server to.
* `-w \u003cnumber\u003e`: Set the number of worker processes to spawn.
* `--threads \u003cnumber\u003e`: Set the number of threads per worker process.
* `--timeout \u003cseconds\u003e`: Set the timeout for inactive connections.
* `--log-level \u003clevel\u003e`: Set the logging level (e.g., debug, info, warning).

For a complete list of options, refer to the Gunicorn documentation: https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html

**Example with Options:**

```bash
gunicorn app:app -b 0.0.0.0:8080 -w 4 --threads 2 --timeout 60 --log-level info
```

This command starts the server:

* Listening on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 8080.
* Spawning 4 worker processes.
* Using 2 threads per worker.
* Setting the connection timeout to 60 seconds.
* Logging with the info level.
