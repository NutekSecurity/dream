## WebSphere Web Server

### Introduction

WebSphere Web Server (IHS), formerly known as IBM HTTP Server (IHS), is a high-performance web server designed for dynamic and static content across multiple platforms. As part of the WebSphere Application Server family, it offers advanced security, load balancing, and scalability features to serve web applications effectively.

### Key Features

* **Supports Multiple Web Servers:** IHS can manage a cluster of web servers for robust performance and improved availability.
* **Dynamic Content Serving:** IHS integrates seamlessly with WebSphere Application Server and other IBM products to deliver dynamic content generated by servlets, JSPs, PHP scripts, and other technologies.
* **Static Content Serving:** It efficiently serves static files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and multimedia content.
* **Reverse Proxy Functionality:** IHS acts as a reverse proxy, routing HTTP and HTTPS requests to backend application servers based on defined rules and load balancing algorithms.
* **Content Caching:** IHS can cache static content and dynamically generated content, reducing response times and optimizing network usage.
* **Plugin Architecture:** It supports plugins for extending its functionality, including authentication, authorization, content transformation, and protocol manipulation.
* **Security Features:** IHS offers advanced security features, including SSL/TLS encryption, single sign-on (SSO) integration, and access control.

### Benefits

* **Improved Performance:** With load balancing, caching, and plugin architecture, IHS optimizes web application performance and responsiveness.
* **High Availability:** The ability to manage multiple web servers in a cluster ensures continuous availability even during server failures.
* **Advanced Security:** IHS protects web applications and sensitive data with advanced security mechanisms.
* **Scalability:** It scales effectively to meet changing workload demands, supporting high concurrency and large data volumes.
* **Integration with IBM Ecosystem:** Close integration with other IBM products like WebSphere Application Server provides a comprehensive enterprise platform for web application development and deployment.

### Use Cases

* Serving dynamic and static web content across multiple platforms
