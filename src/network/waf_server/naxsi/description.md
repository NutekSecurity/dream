# NAXSI WAF Server
## NAXSI WAF Server

## Specifics:

NAXSI is an open-source **web application firewall (WAF)** for NGINX written in Lua and C. It provides security and protection against a wide range of attacks, including **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, **SQL Injection (SQLi)**, **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**, and more.

### Architecture and Key Features:

1. **NGINX Compatibility:** Runs as a Lua module for NGINX, making it easily integratable and scalable.
2. **Open Source:** Freely available under the GNU General Public License, allowing for customization and community support.
3. **Rule Engine:** Uses regular expressions and pattern matching for signature-based detection and blocking.
4. **Advanced Filtering:** Implements sophisticated techniques like whitelisting, blacklisting, and IP blocking for granular control.
5. **Performance Tuning:** Optimizes performance through caching and load balancing mechanisms for efficiency.
6. **Security Hardening:** Includes measures to mitigate OWASP Top 10 risks and secure your web applications.
7. **Logging and Alerts:** Provides detailed logging for analysis and alerts admins on suspicious activities.
8. **Customizability:** Supports custom rule development and integration of third-party modules for extended capabilities.

### Deployment Options:

1. **Standalone Mode:** Installs on the NGINX server directly as a dynamically loaded module.
2. **Docker Container:** Leverages pre-configured Docker containers for simplified and isolated deployment.
