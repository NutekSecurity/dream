# ModSecurity WAF Server
## ModSecurity WAF Server 

### Introduction

ModSecurity is a free, open-source web application firewall (WAF) that can be used to protect web applications from a variety of attacks, including:

* **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**
* **SQL injection**
* **Local file inclusion (LFI)**
* **Remote file inclusion (RFI)**
* **Command injection**
* **Denial-of-service (DoS)**

ModSecurity can be configured to run in either intrusion detection mode or inline mode. In intrusion detection mode, ModSecurity will log suspicious activity but will not block the offending request. In inline mode, ModSecurity will block the offending request and can also send a custom response to the client.

### Installation

ModSecurity can be installed on a variety of web servers, including Apache, Nginx, and IIS. The installation process is relatively straightforward and can be completed in a few minutes.

### Configuration

Once ModSecurity is installed, it must be configured to protect the web application. The configuration file is located at `/etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf`. The configuration file contains a number of rules that define what types of attacks ModSecurity should detect and block.

### Rules

ModSecurity comes with a number of built-in rules. These rules are designed to protect against a variety of common attacks. However, it is important to review the built-in rules and add any additional rules that are specific to your web application.

### Logging

ModSecurity logs all activity to a file. The log file can be used to track suspicious activity and to debug problems.

### Security

ModSecurity is a powerful tool that can be used to protect web applications from a variety of attacks. However, it is important to use ModSecurity in a secure manner. This means ensuring that the configuration file is secure and that the ModSecurity software is up to date.
