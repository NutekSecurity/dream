# SDN Server
## SDN Server: An Overview

While the term \"SDN Server\" doesn't represent a specific type of server in the traditional sense, it encompasses the concept of a central entity responsible for managing and controlling network resources within an SDN (Software-Defined Networking) environment. This central entity, often referred to as an **SDN controller** or **SDN management system**, can be implemented as a dedicated server or utilize the capabilities of a regular server to perform its functions. 

Let's explore the different aspects of an SDN Server:

**1. Functions:**

* **Centralized Network Management:** The SDN server acts as a central point for managing network devices like switches, routers, and firewalls. It configures, monitors, and controls these devices based on policies and application requirements.
* **Policy Configuration:** The SDN server defines and implements policies that govern network behavior. These policies could be based on security requirements, quality of service (QoS) levels, or specific application needs.
* **Forwarding Rules:** The SDN server calculates and distributes forwarding rules to network devices. These rules determine how network traffic should be routed across the network.
* **Abstraction:** The SDN server hides the underlying network complexity from applications and users, providing a simplified and unified view of the network.
* **Automation:** The SDN server automates network configuration and management tasks, reducing manual intervention and improving operational efficiency.
* **Dynamic Control:** The SDN server allows for dynamic adjustments to network settings in response to changing network conditions or application needs.

**2. Implementation:**

* **Dedicated Hardware:** In some cases, the SDN server may be implemented on dedicated hardware specifically designed for high-performance networking tasks. This provides advantages in terms of scalability and processing power.
* **Virtualization:** Often, the SDN server is implemented as a software application that can run on a virtual machine or containerized environment. This offers flexibility and resource optimization.
* **Distributed Architecture:** In larger networks, the SDN server functionality may be distributed across multiple physical or virtual servers, improving fault tolerance and scalability.

**3. OpenFlow and Other Protocols:**

* The SDN server typically relies on protocols like OpenFlow to communicate with network devices and program their forwarding behavior. OpenFlow allows the server to install and update forwarding rules dynamically.
* Other protocols used by SDN servers may include NETCONF and REST APIs for configuration and management purposes.

**4. Benefits:**

* **Flexibility:** SDN servers enable dynamic and programmable network control, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements and application demands.
* **Agility:** SDN facilitates rapid service provisioning and network reconfiguration, increasing operational agility.
* **Scalability:** SDN allows for flexible scaling of network resources to accommodate growing network traffic and user demands.
* **Efficiency:** SDN automates network tasks, minimizing manual configuration and management overhead, leading to improved operational efficiency.
* **Security:** SDN allows for centralized security policy enforcement and monitoring, enhancing network security posture.

* OpenDaylight
* Floodlight
* Ryu
* ONOS
* VMware NSX
