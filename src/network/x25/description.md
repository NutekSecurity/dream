# X.25 Network Protocol

## X.25 Network Protocol Explained

The X.25 protocol is a packet-switching network protocol used in the X.25 network. Developed by the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT), it's standardized by ITU-T Recommendation X.25. 

Here's a breakdown of its key features:

**What it is:**
* A packet-switched network technology designed to provide reliable data transmission over unreliable networks, like public telephone lines.
* A Layer 3 protocol in the OSI model, responsible for routing and flow control.

**Benefits:**
* **Reliable data transmission:** X.25 offers error detection and correction, ensuring data integrity even on unreliable networks.
* **Virtual circuits:** It establishes virtual circuits, dedicated connections between devices, simplifying data flow management.
* **Flow control:** X.25 implements flow control mechanisms, adapting to different data rates and preventing network congestion.
* **Economical data transfer:** By breaking data into packets, X.25 optimizes network utilization and reduces costs.

**Technical aspects:**
* **Packet switching:** Data is divided into packets and sent over the network independently, taking the most efficient route.
* **Error checking and correction:** Each packet includes error checks to identify and correct errors during transmission.
* **Flow control:** Sending and receiving devices negotiate data transfer rates to prevent overwhelming the receiving device.
* **Virtual circuits:** X.25 creates dedicated virtual circuits between devices, similar to physical connections, offering reliable and consistent communication.

**Applications:**
* **Leased lines \u0026 dial-up connections:** X.25 was widely used for leased lines and dial-up connections for various applications like point-of-sale systems, ATMs, and data terminals.
* **Frame Relay and ATM networks:** X.25 served as the foundation for later technologies like Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).
* **Legacy systems:** While not as prevalent today, X.25 is still used in some legacy systems due to its reliability and compatibility.

**Additional points:**
* X.25 utilizes a complex system of control packets for call setup, data transfer, and error handling.
* It supports different packet sizes, addressing schemes, and quality-of-service levels.
* Security features are limited, relying mostly on access control lists and password authentication.
