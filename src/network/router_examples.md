# Router examples

It seems like you're asking about router examples, but you didn't specify a programming language or a framework. 

For instance, if you're asking about Express.js (a Node.js framework), a basic router example would look like this:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

module.exports = router;
```

This code creates a new router object, defines a route on it, and then exports the router. The route responds with 'Hello World!' when a GET request is made to the root URL.

If you're asking about a different language or framework, please provide more details.

Certainly! Here are some examples of different types of routers:

1. **Home Router**: This is the most common type of router used in households. It connects to your modem and allows multiple devices within your home to access the internet wirelessly (Wi-Fi) or via Ethernet cables.

2. **Enterprise Router**: These routers are designed for businesses and organizations. They often have more advanced features such as support for Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), multiple WAN (Wide Area Network) connections, and better security options.

3. **Wireless Router**: Also known as Wi-Fi routers, these devices allow wireless communication between devices within a specific area (such as a home or office) and provide internet access. They often have multiple antennas for better coverage and support for the latest Wi-Fi standards like 802.11ac or 802.11ax.

4. **Core Router**: These routers are used within large networks, such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or large enterprises, to manage traffic between different networks. They are high-performance routers capable of handling large amounts of data traffic.

5. **Edge Router**: Edge routers are positioned at the edge of a network, connecting it to external networks such as the internet. They often perform functions like firewalling, NAT (Network Address Translation), and traffic management.

6. **Modem Router Combo**: Some internet service providers offer modem-router combo devices, which combine the functionality of a modem and a router into a single device. These are convenient for home users who want a simpler setup.

7. **Virtual Router**: A virtual router is a software-based router that runs on a virtual machine or a container. It is often used in virtualized or cloud environments where physical routers may not be practical.

8. **Open Source Router**: There are several open-source router projects like OpenWrt, DD-WRT, and pfSense, which provide customizable router firmware. Users can install these on compatible router hardware to extend functionality or improve performance.

9. **Industrial Router**: These routers are designed for use in industrial environments where they may be exposed to harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures, humidity, or vibrations. They often have ruggedized enclosures and support for industrial protocols.

10. **Mobile Router (Mi-Fi)**: These routers use cellular data networks to provide internet access on the go. They are portable and often used when traveling or in areas where wired internet connections are not available.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other specialized routers designed for specific purposes or industries.

Here are some real world examples of routers:

* **Home Wi-Fi Router:** This is the most common type of router, and it connects your home devices to the internet. It typically has four Ethernet ports for wired connections and a built-in antenna for wireless connectivity. 

* **Business Router:** Businesses often use more powerful routers than home users, with features such as load balancing and VPN support. These routers can handle a larger number of devices and more traffic.

* **Mobile Router:** A mobile router is a small, portable device that can be used to create a Wi-Fi hotspot from a cellular data connection. This is useful for travelers or people who need to connect to the internet in areas where there is no Wi-Fi available.

* **Core Router:** Core routers are the high-performance routers that form the backbone of the internet. They are responsible for routing traffic between different networks.
