# IGMP Network Protocol

## IGMP Network Protocol Explained

The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is a communication protocol used by IPv4 hosts to join and leave multicast groups on an IP network. **It allows routers to efficiently deliver multicast traffic only to the interested hosts, reducing network congestion and improving overall performance.**

### Functionality

Here's how IGMP works:

1. **Multicast Group Membership:** Hosts send IGMP messages to inform routers about their interest in joining or leaving multicast groups.
2. **Router Group Membership Table:** Routers maintain a table of which interfaces are interested in each multicast group.
3. **Multicast Traffic Forwarding:** Routers only forward multicast traffic to interfaces that have members interested in the specific group.

### Versions

There are three main versions of IGMP:

* **IGMPv1:** The original version, offering basic functionality.
* **IGMPv2:** Offers improvements like report suppression and group membership queries.
* **IGMPv3:** The latest version, featuring additional features like filtering based on source address and support for sparse mode.

### Applications

IGMP is commonly used in various applications, including:

* **Video conferencing:** Multicast allows efficient delivery of video streams to multiple participants.
* **Online gaming:** Multicast enables efficient communication between players in online games.
* **Software distribution:** Multicast can be used to distribute software updates to multiple devices simultaneously.
* **IP television:** Multicast allows efficient delivery of live TV streams to multiple viewers.

### Specifics

Here are some specific details about IGMP:

* **Message Types:** IGMP defines various message types, including:
 add-network-protocols.rb network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links Membership Report: Sent by hosts to join or leave a group.
 add-network-protocols.rb network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links Membership Query: Sent by routers to request membership information from hosts.
 add-network-protocols.rb network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links Leave Group: Sent by hosts to explicitly leave a group.
* **Group Addressing:** Multicast groups are identified using IP multicast addresses.
* **Security:** IGMP does not provide any security mechanisms by itself. Additional security measures are needed to protect against unauthorized access to multicast groups.

### Resources

Here are some resources for further information on IGMP:

* **IETF IGMP Working Group:** https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/igmp/
* **Wikipedia IGMP Article:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Group_Management_Protocol
