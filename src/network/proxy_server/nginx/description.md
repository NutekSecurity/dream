# Nginx Proxy Server
## Nginx Proxy Server: 

Nginx is a powerful and versatile web server and reverse proxy that can be used to:

* **Improve performance**: By caching static content and reducing the load on your backend servers.
* **Increase security**: By hiding your backend servers from the internet and filtering traffic.
* **Provide load balancing**: By distributing traffic across multiple backend servers.
* **Offer SSL termination**: By handling SSL encryption and decryption without involving your backend servers.
* **Add custom functionality**: By writing custom modules to extend Nginx's capabilities.

### Setting up an Nginx Proxy Server:

Here are the basic steps to set up an Nginx proxy server:

1. **Install Nginx**: 
Use your package manager to install Nginx. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```
2. **Configure Nginx**: Edit the Nginx configuration file, typically located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. 
Within the `http` block, you can define different server blocks for your proxy settings. A basic example:
```
server {
 listen 80;
 server_name example.com;

 location / {
 proxy_pass http://backend.example.com;
 proxy_set_header Host $host;
 proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
 }
}
```
This configuration listens on port 80 for `example.com` and proxies all requests to `http://backend.example.com`.
3. **Test and start Nginx**: Use the `nginx -t` command to test your configuration for syntax errors. Then, start or restart Nginx with `service nginx start` or `service nginx restart`.
