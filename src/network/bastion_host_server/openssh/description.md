# OpenSSH Bastion Host Server
## OpenSSH Bastion Host Server: An in-depth guide

### Understanding the Bastion Host

Before diving into the specifics, let's define what a Bastion Host is and its key characteristics:

**Concept:**

- An intermediary server situated within your infrastructure's perimeter network.
- Acts as a single point of entry into your main network, enhancing security for internal resources.

**Benefits:**

- **Centralized SSH Access:** Simplifies management through centralized SSH authentication instead of managing individual SSH access on target resources.
- **Improved Security:**
 - Reduces the attack surface of internal servers by not directly exposing them to the public internet.
 - Enables auditing user activity by consolidating all SSH traffic through the Bastion Host.
 - Allows for stronger security configurations like disabling password authentication or enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA).
 - Centralizes and restricts privileged access, minimizing lateral movement within the network.
- **Compliance-focused:** Fulfills compliance mandates that require stricter access controls for sensitive networks or data.

**Key characteristics:**

- Jump server functionality allows access to internal servers using various methods like direct connection, port forwarding, SSH SOCKS proxy.
- Should not hold or process sensitive data on its own.
- Maintains separate and distinct user accounts from internal servers for improved auditability.

### OpenSSH Configuration Guide

Now, let's explore setting up your OpenSSH Bastion Host:

**1. Installation and setup:**

- Install the `openssh-server` package on your chosen machine.
- Edit the OpenSSH configuration file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

**2. Security configuration settings:**

- Disable password authentication and configure strong public-key authentication for improved security.
- Limit connections from specific addresses using \"AllowUsers\" or \"DenyUsers\" directives.
- Configure account restrictions like \"ChrootDirectory\" or \"ForceCommand\" for further security and control.
- Enable strong SSH hardening options like limiting idle timeout, enabling TCP forwarding or X11 forwarding if needed.
- Enforce PAM modules for additional authentication layers or restricting certain user operations.
- Enable logging and use SSH logging facilities with the \"LogLevel\" directive for auditing and security event analysis.

**3. Jumphost and port forwarding options:**

- Utilize OpenSSH user forwarding functionality by enabling \"AllowTcpForwarding\" and specific authorized user options like \"PermitOpen\".
- Configure port forwarding through the Bastion Host using the \"-L\", \"-R\", \"-D\" command line options in OpenSSH client.

**4. SSH bastion access for users:**

- Generate private SSH keys for individual users and add their public keys to their respective authorized_keys files on the Bastion Host.
- Restrict and authorize specific commands using forcecommand options for improved user access management and policy enforcement.

**5. Security Monitoring and Logging:**

- Implement and utilize a centralized log aggregation and analysis mechanism for the Bastion Host and other infrastructure assets.
- Monitor logs for unauthorized connections, brute force attacks, and anomalous user activity.
- Leverage your SIEM or log analysis systems to generate actionable alerts and reports from security events on the Bastion Host.

**6. Maintenance and additional considerations:**

- Keep your software, including OpenSSH, regularly updated.
- Securely transfer files to internal machines via SCP protocol and never directly from the Bastion Host itself.
- Implement appropriate firewall rules for network isolation and access filtering on the Bastion Host and network infrastructure.
- Conduct ongoing security assessments and penetration testing to validate configurations and identify potential vulnerabilities.

**By implementing OpenSSH properly you can significantly boost your infrastructure security while facilitating smooth user access and control.** I encourage you to research further as needed and customize configuration settings based on your specific needs and security framework.

**Remember, securing your OpenSSH Bastion Host configuration takes careful planning and continuous monitoring to maintain strong security posture across your network.**
