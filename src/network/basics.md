# Basics of networking

**Basic networking concepts:**

* **IP address:** An IP address is a unique identifier that is assigned to each device on a network. IP addresses are used to route traffic between devices on the network.
* **Subnet mask:** A subnet mask is used to divide a network into smaller subnetworks. Subnetworks are useful for organizing and managing networks.
* **Gateway:** A gateway is a device that connects two networks together. Gateways are used to route traffic between networks.
* **Router:** A router is a device that forwards traffic between networks. Routers use routing tables to determine the best path to forward traffic.
* **Switch:** A switch is a device that connects devices on a network together. Switches allow devices to communicate with each other without having to go through a central device, such as a router.

**Types of networks:**

* **Local area network (LAN):** A LAN is a small network that is typically confined to a single building or campus. LANs are often used in homes and businesses to connect computers, printers, and other devices together.
* **Wide area network (WAN):** A WAN is a large network that can span cities, countries, or even the entire world. WANs are often used to connect businesses and organizations to each other, and to connect to the internet.
* **Wireless network:** A wireless network is a network that uses radio waves to connect devices together. Wireless networks are often used in homes and businesses to provide convenient access to the internet and other resources.

**Network security:**

Network security is important for protecting networks from unauthorized access and attack. There are a number of different network security measures that can be implemented, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption.

## OSI Model

The OSI model is a conceptual model that describes the different layers of a network. It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1984, and it is used to standardize the way networks are designed and implemented.

The OSI model has seven layers, each of which has a specific function. The layers are:

* **Physical layer:** The physical layer is responsible for transmitting raw data over a physical medium, such as a cable or wireless signal.

* **Data link layer:** The data link layer is responsible for transmitting data between two nodes on the same network. It is also responsible for error detection and correction.

* **Network layer:** The network layer is responsible for routing data between different networks. It is also responsible for addressing and packet forwarding.

* **Transport layer:** The transport layer is responsible for delivering data to the correct application on a device. It is also responsible for error detection and correction.

* **Session layer:** The session layer is responsible for establishing and maintaining connections between devices. It is also responsible for managing sessions.

* **Presentation layer:** The presentation layer is responsible for converting data into a format that can be understood by the application layer. It is also responsible for encryption and decryption.

* **Application layer:** The application layer is responsible for providing services to applications. It is also responsible for user authentication and data encryption.

The OSI model is a useful tool for understanding how networks work. It can be used to troubleshoot network issues, and it can also be used to design new networks.

## TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP model is a conceptual model that describes the different layers of a network. It was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 1983, and it is used to standardize the way networks are designed and implemented.

The TCP/IP model has four layers, each of which has a specific function. The layers are:

* **Application layer:** The application layer is responsible for providing services to applications. It is also responsible for user authentication and data encryption.

* **Transport layer:** The transport layer is responsible for delivering data to the correct application on a device. It is also responsible for error detection and correction.

* **Internet layer:** The internet layer is responsible for routing data between different networks. It is also responsible for addressing and packet forwarding.

* **Network access layer:** The network access layer is responsible for transmitting raw data over a physical medium, such as a cable or wireless signal.
