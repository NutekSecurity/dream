## ISC DHCP Server

## Introduction

The ISC DHCP Server is an open-source, production-quality DHCP server implementation developed by the Internet Systems Consortium (ISC). It is widely used in various environments, including small home networks, large enterprise networks, and cloud deployments.

## Capabilities

Here are some key capabilities of the ISC DHCP Server:

* **Dynamic IP address allocation:** Assigns IP addresses to DHCP clients automatically, eliminating the need for manual configuration.
* **DHCP failover:** Provides redundancy and high availability by allowing multiple DHCP servers to share the same configuration and cooperate to serve clients.
* **DHCP relay agent:** Forwards DHCP requests and replies between clients and servers on different network segments.
* **DHCP snooping:** Enforces DHCP security by preventing unauthorized DHCP servers from operating on the network.
* **VLAN support:** Assigns clients to specific VLANs based on their MAC addresses or other criteria.
* **PXE support:** Used for booting network-installable operating systems.
* **Vendor extensions:** Supports various vendor-specific options, allowing for customization and integration with other network devices.

## Key Features
