# FTP Network Protocol

## FTP Network Protocol:

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server over a network. It is a client-server protocol, meaning that one computer acts as the client and another acts as the server.

### Key Features of FTP:

* **File Transfer:** FTP is primarily used for transferring files between computers. This includes uploading and downloading files, as well as moving and renaming files on the server.
* **File Management:** FTP also provides basic file management capabilities on the server. This includes creating and deleting directories, as well as listing the contents of a directory.
* **Authentication and Security:** FTP uses usernames and passwords for authentication. It also supports various security mechanisms, including SSL/TLS encryption, to protect data in transit.
* **Two Modes of Operation:** FTP operates in two modes: active and passive. In active mode, the client initiates the data connection to the server. In passive mode, the server initiates the data connection to the client.
* **Standardized Protocol:** FTP is a standardized protocol defined in RFCs 959 and 960. This ensures interoperability between different FTP clients and servers.

### How FTP Works:

1. **Connection Establishment:** The client connects to the server using a TCP connection on port 21.
2. **Authentication:** The client sends its username and password to the server for authentication.
3. **Command and Data Channels:** Two channels are established for communication:
 add-network-protocols.rb network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links A command channel on port 21 for sending commands and receiving responses.
 add-network-protocols.rb network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links A data channel for transferring files.
4. **File Transfer:** The client sends commands to the server to upload, download, or manage files.
5. **Connection Termination:** Once the file transfer is complete, the client closes the connection.

### FTP Commands:

FTP uses a set of commands to interact with the server. Some of the commonly used commands include:

* `USER`: Sends the username to the server.
* `PASS`: Sends the password to the server.
* `CWD`: Changes the current working directory on the server.
* `CDUP`: Moves up one directory level on the server.
* `LIST`: Lists the files and directories in the current directory on the server.
* `RETR`: Downloads a file from the server.
* `STOR`: Uploads a file to the server.
* `DELE`: Deletes a file on the server.
* `RMD`: Deletes a directory on the server.
* `MKD`: Creates a directory on the server.
* `QUIT`: Terminates the connection.

### Security Considerations:

FTP was originally designed without security in mind. However, several security mechanisms have been added over the years to improve its security. These include:

* **SSL/TLS Encryption:** This encrypts the data transferred between the client and the server, protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering.
* **User Authentication and Access Control:** This allows administrators to control which users can access the FTP server and what actions they can perform.
* **Firewalls and Network Security:** Firewalls and other network security measures can be used to restrict access to the FTP server from unauthorized sources.

### Applications of FTP:

FTP is widely used for a variety of applications, including:

* **Website publishing:** Web developers use FTP to upload their websites to web servers.
* **File sharing:** Users can share files with others by uploading them to an FTP server and providing the recipient with the login credentials.
* **Software distribution:** Software developers often use FTP to distribute software updates to their users.
* **Backup and Disaster Recovery:** FTP can be used to back up files to a remote server in case of a disaster.

### Conclusion:

FTP is a versatile and widely used protocol for transferring files over networks. While it was originally designed without security in mind, several security mechanisms have been added over the years to improve its security. However, it is important to be aware of the security risks associated with FTP and take appropriate measures to protect your data.
