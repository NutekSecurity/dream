# nftables Firewall Server
## nftables Firewall Server

**What is nftables?**

nftables is a new firewall framework in the Linux kernel. It offers many advantages over the legacy iptables, including:

* **Object-oriented design:** nftables allows you to define objects like tables, chains, sets, and rules. This makes it easier to manage and understand your firewall configuration.
* **Dynamic updates:** nftables allows you to update your firewall rules without restarting the firewall. This is useful for making changes on the fly or for automating your firewall configuration.
* **Enhanced security:** nftables offers several new features that improve security, such as connection tracking and NAT.

**How to use nftables as a firewall server?**

To use nftables as a firewall server, you need to:

1. **Define your firewall policy:** Decide what traffic you want to allow and what traffic you want to block. This will help you determine which rules to create in your nftables configuration.
2. **Create your nftables configuration:** Write your nftables configuration using the `nft` command. This includes defining your tables, chains, sets, and rules.
3. **Load your nftables configuration:** Use the `nft` command to load your configuration into the kernel. This will activate your firewall rules.
4. **Monitor your firewall:** Use tools like `nft list` and `nft monitor` to monitor your firewall's activity. This will help you troubleshoot any problems and ensure that your firewall is working as expected.
