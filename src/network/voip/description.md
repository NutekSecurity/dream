# VoIP Network Protocol

## VoIP Network Protocol: A Comprehensive Breakdown

VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) relies on various Network Protocols to enable voice communication over data networks. This section will delve into specific protocols critical for VoIP operation:

### 1. Signalling Protocols:

* **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol):** Most popular, text-based protocol for establishing, managing, and terminating multimedia sessions. Used for call setup, call control, and feature negotiation.
* **H.323:** Older protocol suite encompassing several protocols for multimedia communication, including call setup, media control, and registration. Less widely used now compared to SIP.
* **MGCP (Media Gateway Control Protocol):** Developed by Cisco, used by media gateways to control call processing and media streams. network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links **Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP):** Cisco proprietary protocol for controlling IP phones and managing call features.


### 2. Media Transport Protocols:

* **RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol):** Delivers voice and video data in real-time, ensuring timely delivery and minimizing delay.
* **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Preferred underlying transport protocol for RTP due to its lower latency compared to TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).
* **RTCP (Real-time Transport Control Protocol):** Provides feedback on RTP sessions, including statistics like packet loss and jitter.


### 3. Supplementary Protocols:

* **SDP (Session Description Protocol):** Describes multimedia sessions, including codecs, addresses, and ports used for media transmission.
* **IAX2 (Inter-Asterisk eXchange Protocol):** Open-source protocol designed for VoIP communication between Asterisk servers.
