## Kippo Honeypot Server

### What is Kippo?

Kippo is a medium-interaction SSH honeypot that simulates a basic Linux server. It logs the attacker's activities, which can be used to gain insights into their tactics and tools. Kippo is written in Python and is open-source.

### Why use Kippo?

Kippo can be used to:

* **Detect and track attackers:** Kippo logs all attacker activity, including their IP address, the commands they run, and the files they access. This information can be used to identify the attackers and track their movements.
* **Waste the attacker's time:** Kippo can be configured to simulate a real server, which can waste the attacker's time and resources. This can help to deter them from targeting your real systems.
* **Gather intelligence:** Kippo can be used to gather intelligence about the attackers, such as their tools, techniques, and motivations. This information can be used to improve your security posture.

### How to deploy Kippo

Kippo can be deployed in a variety of ways, including:

* **Virtual machine:** Kippo can be deployed on a virtual machine, such as VirtualBox or VMware. This is a good option if you want to isolate the honeypot from your other systems.
* **Docker container:** Kippo can be deployed in a Docker container. This is a convenient option if you want to deploy Kippo on a production system.
* **Cloud provider:** Kippo can be deployed on a cloud provider, such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform. This is a good option if you want to scale your honeypot deployment.
