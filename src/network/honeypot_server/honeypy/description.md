# HoneyPy Honeypot Server
## What is HoneyPy?

HoneyPy is a **lightweight honeypot server** written in Python. It aims to be an easy-to-use and efficient tool for collecting information about attackers and their techniques. It is specifically designed for **low interaction honeypots**, which means it does not actively engage with attackers the way a high interaction honeypot does.

### Features of HoneyPy:

* **Lightweight and easy to deploy:** HoneyPy has a small footprint and can be easily installed on most systems.
* **Modular design:** HoneyPy is composed of several modules that can be easily added or removed to customize the honeypot.
* **Cross-platform:** HoneyPy runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
* **Log analysis tools:** HoneyPy comes with tools for analyzing the logs generated by the honeypot.
* **Support for multiple protocols:** HoneyPy supports a variety of protocols, including SSH, HTTP, FTP, and Telnet.

### Pros and Cons of HoneyPy:

**Pros:**

* **Easy to use and deploy**
* **Lightweight and efficient**
* **Modular design allows for customization**
* **Cross-platform**
* **Log analysis tools included**

**Cons:**

* **Limited functionality compared to high interaction honeypots**
* **May not be suitable for all use cases**

### How to Deploy HoneyPy:

1. **Install HoneyPy:** You can install HoneyPy using `pip` or by downloading the source code from the official GitHub repository.
2. **Configure HoneyPy:** The configuration file allows you to customize the honeypot.
3. **Run HoneyPy:** Start the honeypot server.
4. **Monitor logs:** Regularly check the logs generated by the honeypot to analyze attacker activity.
