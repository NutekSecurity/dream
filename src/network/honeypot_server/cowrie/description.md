# Cowrie Honeypot Server
## Cowrie Honeypot Server

### What is it?

Cowrie is an open-source SSH honeypot designed to log and analyze brute-force attacks and other malicious activity on SSH servers. It emulates a real SSH server, fooling attackers into thinking they have successfully compromised a system. This allows you to gather valuable information about their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) without putting your real servers at risk.

### Key Features:

* **SSH Protocol Emulation:** Cowrie accurately replicates the behavior of a real SSH server, including login prompts, commands, and error messages.
* **Logging and Analysis:** Cowrie logs all attacker activity, including usernames, passwords, commands executed, and IP addresses. This information can be used to analyze attacker behavior and identify patterns.
* **Honeycreds:** Cowrie allows you to configure fake credentials that attackers can steal. This can help you track their movements and identify other compromised systems.
* **Pluggable Architecture:** Cowrie's modular design allows you to add custom plugins to extend its functionality. This includes plugins for logging to external databases, triggering alerts, and integrating with other security tools.
* **Cross-Platform Support:** Cowrie runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows, making it a versatile honeypot solution.

### Benefits:

* **Early Detection:** Cowrie can detect and track malicious activity at an early stage, before attackers can gain access to your real systems.
* **Attacker Information:** You can learn valuable information about attacker TTPs, helping you improve your security posture.
* **Deception:** Cowrie can distract attackers from your real systems, wasting their time and resources.
* **Forensic Evidence:** Cowrie logs provide valuable forensic evidence that can be used to investigate attacks and track down perpetrators.

### Use Cases:

* **Monitoring SSH activity:** Identify and track brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and other malicious activity.
* **Analyzing attacker TTPs:** Learn about the tools, techniques, and procedures used by attackers.
* **Deception and sinkholing:** Distract attackers from your real systems and gather intelligence on their activities.
* **Security research:** Develop and test new security tools and techniques.

### Getting Started with Cowrie:

1. **Installation:** Install Cowrie on your chosen platform.
2. **Configuration:** Configure Cowrie with your desired settings, including honeypot location, logging options, and plugin selection.
3. **Deployment:** Deploy Cowrie on your network where it can be accessed by attackers.
4. **Monitoring:** Monitor Cowrie logs and alerts for suspicious activity.
5. **Analysis:** Analyze the collected data to learn about attacker TTPs and improve your security posture.

### Additional Notes:

* Cowrie is a powerful tool for gathering intelligence on attacker behavior, but it should not be used as a replacement for traditional security measures.
* It's important to configure Cowrie properly to avoid creating false positives or attracting unwanted attention from attackers.
* Regularly update Cowrie to ensure you have the latest security features and bug fixes.
