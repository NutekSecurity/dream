# Suricata IPS Server
## Suricata IPS Server

Suricata is a powerful and open-source network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS). While it can be deployed in various ways, one common configuration is as a server for network-based threat detection and mitigation.

### Key Features of a Suricata IPS Server

* **Packet capture and analysis:** Suricata captures network packets and analyzes them against a set of rules. These rules can identify malicious traffic based on various factors like protocol anomalies, known exploits, and suspicious content.
* **Intrusion detection and prevention:** Based on the analysis, Suricata can either simply detect and log intrusions (IDS mode) or actively block malicious traffic (IPS mode). 
* **Rule customization and expansion:** Suricata comes with a comprehensive set of pre-defined rules, but you can also write custom rules to address specific threats or adapt to your particular network environment. 
* **Multi-threading and performance:** Suricata utilizes multi-threading for efficient processing and analysis of high-speed network traffic. 
* **Multi-platform compatibility:** Suricata runs on various operating systems, including Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS.

### Common Deployment Architectures

**Inline Deployment:**

* Suricata IPS server is placed directly in the network path, typically between the firewall and the internal network. 
* All traffic flows through the server, allowing for real-time inspection and blocking of malicious traffic. 
* This mode offers the highest level of protection but can increase latency and require careful configuration to avoid single points of failure.

**Tap Deployment:**

* Suricata passively monitors network traffic through a network tap or SPAN port. 
* This approach is less intrusive and avoids potential performance bottlenecks.
* However, it may not offer the same level of real-time protection as inline deployment.

### Additional Considerations
