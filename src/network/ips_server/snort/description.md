# Snort IPS Server
## Snort IPS Server Deployment

## Overview

This guide will help you understand and deploy a Snort IPS server on your own system. Snort can be used in multiple modes, with varying levels of configuration complexity. This guide focuses on setting up a basic snort IPS server on a single machine in inline mode.

## Requirements

- Linux server (recommended: Ubuntu Server 20.04+ or CentOS 8+)
- Root privileges on the server
- Internet connectivity

## Installation

There are two main ways to install Snort: directly from source and using a package manager.

### Source installation

Download the latest Snort source code from the official website (https://snort.org/downloads) and extract it. Then, navigate to the extracted directory and run the following commands:

```bash
./configure --enable-sourcefire
make
make install
```

This will compile and install Snort and its dependencies.

### Package manager installation

On Debian-based systems, you can install Snort using apt:

```bash
sudo apt install snort
```

On RHEL-based systems, use yum:

```bash
sudo yum install snort
```

## Configuration

Once Snort is installed, you need to configure it. The main configuration file is located at `/etc/snort/snort.conf`.

### Network settings

First, specify your network interfaces in the `snort.conf` file. Identify the interface connected to your internal network and the one connected to the internet. For example:

```
interface internal {
 # Network interface facing the internal network
 ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
}

interface external {
 # Network interface facing the internet
 ipvar EXTERNAL_NET any
}
```

### Rule sets

Snort uses rule sets to define the traffic it will analyze. Several rule sets are available, including community-maintained rules from Emerging Threats and Snort.org. You can configure Snort to use multiple rule sets.

The most common way to include rule sets is using the \"include\" and \"source\" keywords in the `snort.conf` file. For example:

```
include $RULE_PATH/emerging-attack.rules
include $RULE_PATH/emerging-compromised.rules
```

### Inline mode configuration

Inline mode allows Snort to analyze and block network traffic in real-time. For this, define the interfaces on which Snort will listen and modify the network configuration to route traffic through Snort.

**Step 1:** Configure the snort.conf file with the following options:

```
snort_dynamicengine 1
var ET_DEBUG 0
ipvar ET_HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
ipvar ET_EXTERNAL_NET 0.0.0.0/0
var EXTERNAL_NET 0.0.0.0/0
var HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
var INGRESS_VLAN \"internal\"
var EGRESS_VLAN \"external\"
```

**Step 2:** Modify iptables rules:

```bash
iptables -I FORWARD 1 -i $INGRESS_VLAN -o $EGRESS_VLAN -j SNORT

iptables -I FORWARD 1 -i $EGRESS_VLAN -o $INGRESS_VLAN -j SNORT

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $EXTERNAL_NET -j SNAT --to-source $INGRESS_IP
```

**Step 3:** Restart Snort and iptables services:

```bash
service snort restart
service iptables save
```

## Testing and Monitoring

After configuring Snort, test its functionality by generating test traffic or sending legitimate traffic through the system. Monitor the logs for alerts and analyze them to refine your rules and identify potential threats.

## Important Notes

- Always keep Snort and its rule sets updated.
- Monitor Snort logs regularly and analyze alerts to respond to potential threats and refine your rules.
- This guide provides a basic understanding of Snort IPS server deployment. More advanced configurations exist for specific use cases and environments. Refer to the official Snort documentation for detailed information.
