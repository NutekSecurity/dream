# OSSEC IPS Server
## Using OSSEC as an IPS Server

OSSEC is a powerful intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS) that can be used in various ways to improve your network security posture. 

Here's how you can implement OSSEC as an IPS server:

### 1. Installation and Configuration:

- Ensure your system meets the OSSEC's system requirements (https://docs.ossec.com/en/stable/installation/requirements/).
- Download and install OSSEC using either:
 LICENSE README.md go.mod go.sum lol.rb main.go prompt-response prompt-subject run-prompt-subject.rb **Package Manager:**
 1. Add `https://updates.atomicorp.com/ubuntu.ossec.list` or `https://ossec-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/linux_package_installation.html` depending on your operating system.
 2. Install the appropriate OSSEC package using apt, yum, or appropriate for your system.
 LICENSE README.md go.mod go.sum lol.rb main.go prompt-response prompt-subject run-prompt-subject.rb **Source Code:**
 1. Download the latest version from https://www.ossec.net/download/.
 2. Install using ./install.sh command, following the on-screen instructions.
- Run `ossec-control start` to initiate the ossec services.
- Ensure the OSSEC daemon is running with `ossec-control status`.
- Configure and activate the Agent on the server using ossec-agentd /var/ossec/etc/client.keys

### 2. Enabling IPS Features:

- Edit your `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` configuration file.
- Modify the `rootcheck-only`, `syscheck-root-command`, and `rootcheck-monitor-mode` directives according to your need for system monitoring and rootkit detection.
- Modify the `deny_rules` directive by setting it to \"yes\" to activate real-time blocking triggered by specific rule violations. This enables the IPS functionality.

### 3. Fine-Tuning Rule Set:

- Use the ossec-logtest utility with various rules to evaluate their functionality on real data before activating them for your IPS server.
- Customize existing rules or write new rules to address specific threats or adapt them to your unique environment.

### 4. Advanced IPS Configuration (Optional):

- For a fully functional IDS system, integrate OSSEC with other security infrastructure through functionalities like syslog-forward, network IDS (snort/suricata), SIEM/Log aggregation.
- Configure email and Slack integration to receive notifications for triggered IPS alerts.

## Conclusion
By implementing and properly configuring OSSEC as an IPS server, you enhance your network's defense against various malicious activities. Remember to adjust configurations and fine-tune rules based on your specific security goals and monitored environments.
