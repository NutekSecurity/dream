```

2. **Generate server keys:**
```
wg genkey | tee server_private.key
wg pubkey \u003c server_private.key \u003e server_public.key
```

3. **Create a server configuration file:**
```
sudo vim /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```

Add the following content to the file, replacing the placeholders with your information:

```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = (server_private_key)
Address = (server_public_ip)/32
ListenPort = 51820

[Peer]
PublicKey = (client_public_key)
AllowedIPs = (client_private_ip)/32
```

4. **Start the WireGuard service:**
```
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0
```

### Client Setup

1. **Generate client keys:**

Address = (client_private_ip)/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = (server_public_key)
Endpoint = (server_public_ip):(server_port)
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
```
