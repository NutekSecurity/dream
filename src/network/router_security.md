# Router security

GitHub Copilot: Router security is crucial to protect your network from intrusions and unauthorized access. Here are some general steps you can take to secure your router:

1. **Change Default Admin Credentials**: The first step in securing your router is to change the default username and password. These defaults are well known by attackers and are often the first thing they try.

2. **Update Router Firmware**: Manufacturers often release firmware updates to fix security vulnerabilities. Make sure your router is running the latest firmware.

3. **Disable Remote Management**: Remote management allows you to access your router's settings from anywhere. This can be a security risk, so it's best to disable it unless you really need it.

4. **Use Strong Encryption**: Use a strong encryption method for your Wi-Fi network. WPA3 is currently the strongest available. If your router doesn't support WPA3, use WPA2.

5. **Set Up a Guest Network**: If you have guests who need to use your internet, set up a separate guest network. This will prevent guests from accessing your main network where your sensitive information is.

6. **Disable WPS**: WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) can make it easier to connect new devices to your network, but it also makes your network easier to break into. It's best to disable WPS if your router allows it.

   - Change the default network name (SSID) of your wireless network. Avoid using identifiable information in the SSID that could be used to target your network.

6. **Disable Remote Management:**
   - Disable remote management features unless absolutely necessary. If not properly configured, remote management can pose a security risk by providing attackers with an additional entry point.

7. **Firewall Configuration:**
   - Enable the router's built-in firewall and configure it to filter incoming and outgoing traffic. Review and customize firewall rules to meet the specific needs of your network.

8. **Guest Network:**
   - If your router supports it, set up a separate guest network for visitors. This network should have its own security settings and be isolated from your main network to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive devices.

9. **Disable Unused Services:**
   - Disable any unnecessary services or features on your router. This reduces the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities. For example, if you don't use remote assistance features, disable them.

10. **UPnP (Universal Plug and Play):**
    - Consider disabling UPnP if it's not required. While UPnP can simplify device connectivity, it can also pose security risks by opening ports automatically.

11. **MAC Address Filtering:**
    - Implement MAC address filtering to control which devices are allowed to connect to your network. However, be aware that MAC addresses can be spoofed, so this should not be your sole security measure.

12. **Regular Audits:**
    - Periodically review and audit the connected devices on your network. Ensure that there are no unauthorized devices and that devices with access are still trusted.

13. **Logs and Monitoring:**
    - Enable logging features on your router and regularly review the logs for any suspicious activities. Monitoring network traffic can help detect and respond to security incidents.

14. **Physical Security:**
    - Keep your router in a physically secure location to prevent unauthorized access. Consider placing it in a locked cabinet or a secure room.

15. **Use a Strong Administrator Username:**
    - Change the default administrator username to something unique and hard to guess. This adds an extra layer of security to the router's login credentials.

By following these router security best practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and enhance the overall security of your home or business network. Keep in mind that security is an ongoing process, and regular review and updates are essential to staying protected against evolving threats.

**SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)** is a computer-based system used for controlling and monitoring machines and processes based on real-time data². It is a collection of software and hardware components used for industrial automation which enables managers, engineers, and other industry workers to communicate effectively with the working environment².

Here's how a SCADA system works:

1. **Sensors and Actuators**: Sensors gather data based on physical characteristics like temperature or pressure and transmit it to the SCADA system. Actuators use the data to take a certain action².

2. **Supervisory Computers**: These collect data from the sensors, analyze it, make decisions based on it, and send commands to the actuators².

3. **SCADA Field Controllers**: These devices are located near the field where the process is being controlled. They collect data from sensors, send it to the supervisory computer, and receive commands from the supervisory computer which are afterward sent to the actuators².

4. **Human-Machine Interface (HMI)**: A software application or hardware device that allows operators and engineers to interact with the SCADA system by displaying information in a graphical format².

5. **Communication Infrastructure**: This represents the network of devices and communication protocols used to transmit data between components of SCADA systems².

SCADA systems obtain and collect data from sensors and network devices attached to PLCs or RTUs before converting it into a central control room where it can be analyzed and displayed on HMI into information that humans can understand². The control room operator can then use this information to make decisions and control the remote equipment².
