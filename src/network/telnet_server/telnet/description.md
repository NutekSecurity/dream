# Telnet Server
## What is a Telnet Server?

A Telnet server is a program that listens for incoming connections on a specific port (usually port 23) and allows clients to connect and interact with the server using the Telnet protocol. Telnet is a simple text-based protocol that allows users to remotely access and control a computer.

## Features of a Telnet Server:

* **Remote access:** Telnet allows users to connect to a server from anywhere in the world, as long as they have an internet connection.
* **Text-based interface:** Telnet uses a simple text-based interface, which makes it easy to use and understand.
* **File transfer:** Telnet can be used to transfer files between a client and a server.
* **User authentication:** Telnet servers can be configured to require users to authenticate themselves before they can access the server.
* **Security:** Telnet is not a secure protocol, so it is important to take steps to secure your Telnet server, such as using strong passwords and encryption.

## Popular Telnet Servers and Clients:

* **Servers:**

 LICENSE README.md go.mod go.sum lol.rb main.go prompt-response prompt-subject run-prompt-subject.rb SecureCRT

## How to Use a Telnet Server:

1. Install a Telnet server on the computer you want to access.
2. Configure the Telnet server to listen on the desired port (usually port 23).
3. Start the Telnet server.
4. On the client computer, open a Telnet client and connect to the server using the server's IP address or hostname.
5. Log in to the server using your username and password.
6. Once you are logged in, you can use the Telnet client to send commands to the server and receive responses.

## Security Considerations:

* **Use strong passwords:** Make sure to use strong passwords for all accounts on your Telnet server.
* **Enable encryption:** If possible, enable encryption on your Telnet server to protect your data from being intercepted.
* **Use a firewall:** Use a firewall to block unauthorized access to your Telnet server.
* **Keep your software up to date:** Make sure to keep your Telnet server software up to date to fix any security vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion:

Telnet servers are a powerful tool that can be used to manage and control computers remotely. However, it is important to take steps to secure your Telnet server to protect your data from unauthorized access.
