While I can't physically operate your server, I can guide you through the process of stopping and uninstalling Dropbear SSH Server on different operating systems. Please remember to tailor the following instructions to your specific situation.

**Stopping Dropbear SSH Server:**

**On Linux (such as Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Red Hat):**

1. **Using systemctl:**

```
sudo systemctl stop dropbear
```

2. **Using service:**

```
sudo service dropbear stop
```

**On macOS:**

1. **Using launchctl:**

```

**Uninstalling Dropbear SSH Server:**

**On Linux:**

**Additional Notes:**

* Make sure you have an alternative way to access your server (e.g., another SSH server) before stopping Dropbear.
* After uninstalling Dropbear, you'll need to restart your server for the changes to take effect.
* Remember to back up your Dropbear configuration file if you want to reinstall it later.
