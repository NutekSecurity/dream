# 2FA broken logic

Flawed two-factor verification (2FA) logic is a security vulnerability that can allow attackers to bypass 2FA and gain unauthorized access to accounts. This vulnerability can occur in a variety of ways, such as:

* **Incorrectly validating 2FA codes:** If the 2FA logic does not properly validate the 2FA codes that users enter, attackers may be able to enter invalid codes and still be granted access to accounts.
* **Allowing multiple login attempts with the same 2FA code:** If the 2FA logic allows users to log in multiple times with the same 2FA code, attackers may be able to intercept a user's 2FA code and use it to log in to the user's account multiple times.
* **Not requiring 2FA for all sensitive actions:** If the 2FA logic does not require 2FA for all sensitive actions, such as changing a user's password or withdrawing money from their account, attackers may be able to perform these actions without the user's knowledge or consent.

The PortSwigger tutorial about flawed 2FA logic describes a number of techniques that attackers can use to exploit this vulnerability. For example, attackers can use brute force attacks to guess 2FA codes, or they can use phishing attacks to trick users into revealing their 2FA codes.

To protect against flawed 2FA logic, organizations should:

* **Validate 2FA codes properly:** The 2FA logic should validate all 2FA codes that users enter to ensure that they are valid and have not been used previously.
* **Prevent multiple login attempts with the same 2FA code:** The 2FA logic should prevent users from logging in multiple times with the same 2FA code.
* **Require 2FA for all sensitive actions:** The 2FA logic should require 2FA for all sensitive actions, such as changing a user's password or withdrawing money from their account.
* **Use strong 2FA methods:** Organizations should use strong 2FA methods, such as time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) or WebAuthn, to protect against 2FA attacks.

## Summary

Flawed 2FA logic is a security vulnerability that can allow attackers to bypass 2FA and gain unauthorized access to accounts. Organizations can protect against this vulnerability by validating 2FA codes properly, preventing multiple login attempts with the same 2FA code, requiring 2FA for all sensitive actions, and using strong 2FA methods.
