# 2FA simple bypass

Sure. The 2FA simple bypass tutorial example in PortSwigger Academy demonstrates how a flawed implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA) can be bypassed.

In the tutorial, the user is first prompted to enter their username and password. After they have successfully entered their credentials, they are taken to a second page where they are prompted to enter a verification code. The verification code is sent to the user's phone via SMS.

However, the tutorial website is flawed in the way that it handles the second step of the 2FA process. Specifically, the website does not adequately verify that the user is the same person who entered the username and password in the first step.

This means that an attacker could log in to the website using the victim's username and password, and then change the value of the verification code cookie to any arbitrary value. When the attacker submits the verification code, the website will accept it and the attacker will be logged in.

To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would first need to obtain the victim's username and password. This could be done through a variety of methods, such as phishing or social engineering.

Once the attacker has the victim's credentials, they would need to log in to the website using the username and password. After they have successfully logged in, they would need to find the verification code cookie. The verification code cookie is usually stored in the user's browser.

Once the attacker has found the verification code cookie, they would need to change the value of the cookie to any arbitrary value. They could then submit the verification code and be logged in to the website.

The 2FA simple bypass tutorial example is a good demonstration of how a flawed implementation of 2FA can be exploited. It is important to be aware of these vulnerabilities and to take steps to protect yourself.

Here are some tips for protecting yourself from 2FA bypasses:

* Use a strong password for your 2FA app or token.
* Enable two-factor authentication for all of your online accounts.
* Keep your 2FA app or token up to date with the latest security patches.
* Be suspicious of emails or text messages that ask for your personal information.
* Install antivirus software and keep it up to date.
* Be careful about what websites you visit and what links you click on.
* Train yourself and your employees on how to identify and avoid phishing attacks.

By following these tips, you can help to protect yourself from 2FA bypasses and keep your accounts safe.
