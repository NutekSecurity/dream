(educational usage allowed in schools that directly supports students financially - 
for example MIT and Harvard are not allowed, because the are charging for educational 
services. Following this, they let some students to learn for free, 
using so called scholarship - which in fact is a discount on price of education, 
thus only schools that are not charging for they services are allowed to use this 
content, unless MIT or Harvard-like school would pay student some kind of 
'scholarship' that lands in her bank account or directly in a pocket, and she's 
free to do what she wants with it - 
I'm OK, if this is course for such group of students, not for all school - it
could even be 10$, I'm not picky on some law bending).

```text
If a Harvard, or MIT-like school would like to use this content, I propose 
a course where they do not charge before the course is finished, and then they 
charge for the course, after the student finds a job, and is able to pay 
for the course.
